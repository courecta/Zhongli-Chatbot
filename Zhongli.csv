Paimon: "If you wanna find the Geo Archon, this is the only chance you'll get all year."
Paimon: "Guess it's a good thingVentibrought it up earlier, otherwise we definitely would've missed this year's Rite of Descension."
Traveller: Do you know when it is?
Paimon: "Uhh... might be today, might also be tomorrow..."
Traveller: Do you know where it is?
Paimon: "Well, Venti brought up the time, but Paimon:... knows nothing about where it is... Ehe."
Paimon: "Look, we're already in Liyue so let's go ask some of the locals."
Paimon: "Oh, right. About the Geo Archon, ""Morax""..."
Paimon: Did you know? TheMorathat we use is named after this god.
Paimon: But it's seen as impolite for people from outside Liyue to refer to the Geo Archon by that name.
Paimon: "So we should refer to the Geo Archon by the name Rex Lapis, like the people of Liyue do."
Linlang,"Rite of Descension... Oh yeah, that reminds me, isn't that today?"
Linlang,"Once a year, Rex Lapis bestows upon us his divine prediction, guiding us on how to run Liyue for the coming year."
Linlang,Last year it was theYuhengof theLiyue Qixingthat was given the honor of asking for the divine prediction.
Traveller: Liyue Qixing?
Traveller: Yuheng?
Paimon: Ooh! Paimon: knows this one!
Paimon: Mondstadt is to freedom as Liyue is to contracts. Liyue has a strong focus on business and trade.
Paimon: The Liyue Qixing — the seven leaders of the seven enterprises of Liyue — hold true control over Liyue
Linlang,That's what outlanders always say.
Linlang,But true control over Liyue will always be held by Rex Lapis.
Linlang,"The Qixing is comprised of mere mortals. Rex Lapis is a god. Mondstadt's god is nowhere to be seen, whilst our god is forever with us."
Linlang,Stay in Liyue long enough and you'll see...
Linlang,"Given that you just left your godless city, it's time you experienced what it's like to be in a city whose god has walked with it through all of history."
Paimon: Great! Then we can start our experience off with the Rite of Descension.
Linlang,Good choice. Then get going. To the high ground.
Linlang,Rex Lapis is like a father who takes care of everything for you.
Linlang,I guess Mondstadters are more like orphans in that sense — no father or mother to look after them... They must get lonely sometimes?
Gentry De'an,"Another year, another Rite of Descension... Good news for some, gloom and doom for others..."
Gentry De'an,Huh... Nothing to do with me.
Guanhai,Oh! Are you also visitors here for the Rite of Descension?
Guanhai,To think I've lived in Liyue all these years and never come to see this before.
Guanhai,I guess it's like they say. Locals never visit the tourist spots.
Guanhai,I wish you well on your travels! Liyue always welcomes you!
Paimon: Thanks! So we wanna know where to go if we wanna see the Rite of Descension?
Guanhai,"Hmm... You're not at all close. Not to mention that if I gave you directions, as outlanders, you'd get lost along the way."
Guanhai,"So better to head to Yujing Terrace, to the high ground."
Guanhai,"It's the highest place in the harbor — sounds like the best place for trying to communicate with deities, no?"
Guanhai,Whatever goes on in the Rite of Descension makes no difference to a commoner like me.
Guanhai,"To be honest, I don't think I can be bothered going this year."
Bolai,"You too wish to bear witness to the Rite of Descension? Me too, we all do!"
Bolai,"As a businessman myself, how could I not take interest in Liyue's most important business trends?"
Bolai,The seventeen predictions given last year made more than a few ripples throughout the industry.
Bolai,"What's more, there has been a rumor going around that the Tianquan herself,Ningguang:  has been acting secretly in the shadows..."
Bolai,She wants the rocks created by Geo Vision holders to be exempt from taxation.
Paimon: Wow... that's some super professional legal stuff that is!
Bolai,Haha. To be on the pulse of the predictions and the market is what makes this harbor what it is.
Bolai,"Among The Seven, Rex Lapis is the oldest deity."
Bolai,His keen sense of strategy is well trusted among his people.
Bolai,Understanding the predictions as soon as possible can make all the difference in making your fortune!
Paimon: F—Fortune! So where can we see this Rite of Descension anyway?
Bolai,"Hmm... You're not at all close. Not to mention that if I gave you directions, as outlanders, you'd get lost along the way."
Bolai,"So better to head to Yujing Terrace, to the high ground."
Bolai,"It's the highest place in the harbor — sounds like the best place for trying to communicate with deities, no?"
Bolai,Wonder if I should continue with the retail business for another year...
Bolai,I should be able to make an informed decision once the results of the Rite of Descension are out...
Fan Er'ye,Today is an important day in Liyue! You should get yourself up to Yujing Terrace and get involved.
Jifang,"My husband's gone to take part, too. Says he wants to bear witness to this year in history..."
Jifang,How come he gets to go and have fun while I have to watch the shop?
Paimon: "Paimon: heard that the best time to make a wish is today, during the Rite of Descension. (Traveler), wanna give it a try?"
Assistant of the Tianquan/Millelith Guard,Halt. Those not involved in the proceedings are not permitted to go any further!
Paimon: Pfft... Killjoy...
Ivanovich,"Your first time in Liyue? Actually, it's my first time to see the Rite of Descension too."
Ivanovich,"Ah, look! That's Ms. Ningguang: of the Liyue Qixing!"
Ivanovich,Only those who have control in Liyue can preside over the Rite of Descension.
Ivanovich,"Oh yeah, not sure if you knew, but most of theadeptiappear in the form of various beasts."
Ivanovich,"I heard that when attending these kinds of formal occasions, Rex Lapis himself appears as a celestial cross between two of Liyue's ancient mythical creatures."
Ivanovich,"...Sorry, I shouldn't interrupt your wish. Please, take this."
Traveller: I wish I could get some leads from the Geo Archon.
Ivanovich,"Even for outsiders, the grandeur and solemnity of the proceedings and ceremony leave a deep impression."
Changshun,"Oh, you also want a little adepti luck too?"
Changshun,"Haha, seems you know a lot! Making a wish during this time is sure to get you the blessings of both the Adepti and Rex Lapis himself."
Changshun,"I've already made my wish, so you can take this."
Paimon: "Great, thanks!"
Traveller: I wish I could find my (sister/brother) soon...
Changshun,May your wealth multiply in the year ahead!
Paimon: "Great! Now that we're all done with the wishing, guess we can just wait here for things to get started."
Paimon: "Hmm, who knows how long that Ms. Ningguang: lady is gonna take."
Paimon: Whoa! Look at all the people...
Paimon: We gotta get up front! We can't see squat back here!
Ningguang: The hour is upon us.
Ningguang: Rex Lapis has been killed! Seal the exits!
Paimon: Wha... What's going on!?
Paimon: Did she just say Rex Lapis is...
Paimon: The Geo Archon... is... DEAD!?
Paimon: "Oh no, the Millelith! Looks like they're nabbing suspects who got too close."
Paimon: Paimon:'s freaking out. The killer is amongst us!
Paimon: Wait... we got close... are we suspects!?
Paimon: "Wait, where are you going?"
Traveller: (It was a god we faced off against when we arrived in this world too...)
Traveller: (We can't fall into their hands...)
Paimon: "Oh no... (Traveler), there's a whole bunch of soldiers out there too!"
Paimon: "Your identity... You may not be the killer, but we can't let them get you!"
Paimon: But... can we even get out of here safely?
Ivanovich,"I... I know nothing, I swear..."
Changshun,"The smoke, it's too thick. I can't see..."
Linlang,"I didn't do it! Please, have mercy!"
Jifang,"The smoke, it's too thick. I can't see..."
Fan Er'ye,"I... I know nothing, I swear..."
Millelith Guard,They're here!
Millelith Guard,Arrest them!
Millelith Guard,There's nowhere to run!
Childe:,Hey (buddy/girlie)— Hold still.
Childe:,Come with me.
Paimon: *Panting* Phew... Paimon:'s exhausted...
Traveller: I'm even more beat.
Traveller: Just what muscles does magical floating use exactly?
Paimon: So insensitive! You have no idea just how tiring floating arou— Wait!
Paimon: Just who are you exactly?
Childe:,Call me Childe:.
Paimon: "Childe:? What, so we're supposed to dote on you?"
Childe:,"Haha, no no, not at all. It's an alias of sorts."
Childe:,"In Mondstadt, I don't suppose you came across a ""Signora"" by any chance?"
Paimon: Signora... Childe:...
Paimon: You'reFatui! One of theHarbingers!
Childe:,"Oh, no. Don't worry, I'm not looking for a fight."
Childe:,"Signora gave you quite the bad impression huh? Tsk, that woman... Can't say I'm a fan either."
Childe:,"Right, let's forget all about her, shall we? I'm here to help you."
Traveller: Help?
Childe:,Yes. Help.
Traveller: I don't need help from the Fatui.
Childe:,"Come now, don't be like that."
Traveller: Go. Leave.
Childe:,"Sure, I may be one of the Harbingers, but hear me out."
Childe:,"I'm not a bad guy... Okay perhaps I'm kind of a bad guy, but I'm not here to give you any trouble."
Childe:,Would it be too much to ask for you to keep the sword sheathed?
Childe:,"Haha, I thank you for your knightly nobility, Traveler."
Childe:,"I heard of your deeds in Mondstadt, so I couldn't help but notice you during the proceedings back there."
Childe:,"And because I had my eye on you the whole time, I know it wasn't you. Someone else was clearly behind it."
Childe:,"But... regrettably, given I'm a Fatui envoy from Snezhnaya... there's no way I'd be trusted after something of this magnitude."
Childe:,The ruling Qixing of Liyue has always been overly suspicious of us.
Paimon: Well can you honestly blame them?
Childe:,Hahaha. Guess I shouldn't try to deny that.
Childe:,"Okay, sure. Maintaining a distance between strangers is probably a good idea. Either way, I'm already used to it at this stage."
Childe:,"But right now, if you want to clear yourselves of any suspicion — you need to get yourselves to Northland Bank."
Childe:,Staying here isn't an option. As the old Liyue saying goes :  "The walls have ears."
View Rex Lapis,Life has left the adeptus' great body...
View Rex Lapis,What went on out of view in that moment?
Millelith Soldier,"It's the culprit! The culprit... has returned to the scene of their crime! Don't let them get away! Send reinforcements, repeat, send reinforcements!"
Paimon: "Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh..."
Paimon: Northland Bank...
Childe:,Correct. This bank was opened here in Liyue by Snezhnaya.
Childe:,"Though everyone knows Liyue is the most enterprising in Teyvat, Snezhnaya is not short of change either."
Paimon: "Yeah well, poorer nations don't seem the type to have diplomats that come around acting the way yours do towards the Knights of Favonius."
Childe:,Eh-hehehehe...
Childe:,"Here, let me give you this."
Paimon: This is a...
Childe:,"I'm not sure, exactly. Sometimes, all money can buy is ""things"" and not a name for oneself."
Childe:,All I know is that it's a sigil. A sigil to keep the "mighty and illuminated adepti" from bringing harm to you.
Paimon: Adepti?
Childe:,"If you head north from the harbor, then west from Guili Plains, you will eventually reach a stone forest known an Jueyun Karst."
Childe:,The people of Liyue believe it to be the abode of the adepti.
Traveller: They really believe that?
Traveller: Isn't it just a legend?
Childe:,"Legend or not, they believe it. As such, offerings to the adepti are made at its borders. Nobody dares venture in."
Childe:,But I have no need for believing — not when I know for a fact that the adepti truly exist.
Paimon: "Hate to admit it but your Fatui intel seems alright. But, why would we go looking for adepti anyway?"
Childe:,"Ha, oh my little friend. There are plenty of reasons mortals seek the blessings of adepti."
Childe:,"Money, health, love... But you... you will go for justice."
Paimon: Justice?
Childe:,The Qixing will already have dispatched the Millelith. They'll be seeking out the assassin from amongst the onlookers.
Childe:,But how could a mere mortal kill a god that can sweep aside entire armies? Rex Lapis never gave up his power as a god.
Childe:,This level of crude response is beyond what is called for. How suspicious...
Traveller: You think they're trying to hide the true culprit?
Childe:,Or... to hide something else. Hard to say.
Traveller: You think the Qixing did it and they're trying to pin it on someone else?
Childe:,"Your thinking is even more radical than my own, Honorary Knight."
Childe:,"Even now, the Northland Bank wouldn't be able to hold the Millelith off for long, but the adepti can clear you of any wrongdoing."
???,And who might we be? Those that dare enter Jueyun Karst?
Traveller:  I was sent here.
Traveller:  Please take a look at this.
???,A Sigil of Permission... Many a season has passed since one was last in the presence of such an item.
Moon Carver,"He before you is the mighty and illuminated adeptus, Moon Carver. Speak, traveler. What business have you here?"
Paimon: Actually...
Millelith Sergeant,It's the assassin! They dared to flee here to Jueyun Karst!
Millelith Soldier,"Sir, we've already stepped too far into Jueyun Karst ourselves..."
Millelith Sergeant,"We... Argh, there's no choice. Apprehending the assassin is top priority, we must press on!"
Moon Carver,...disturbing our borders.
Moon Carver,See them gone. One will not have interruption.
Millelith Sergeant,Who goes there?
Millelith Sergeant,Attack!
Millelith Sergeant,Take the target alive!
Millelith Sergeant,Take this!
Moon Carver,"We've digressed. State your purpose, traveler."
Paimon: Well...
Moon Carver,Preposterous...
Moon Carver,PREPOSTEROUS!!!
Moon Carver,The Liyue Qixing... utterly disappointing.
Moon Carver,How could someone possibly assassinate Rex Lapis during the Rite of Descension...
Moon Carver,And then place suspicion upon the attendees!?
Moon Carver,...
Moon Carver,"Traveler, of the unjust accusations placed upon you, one has become aware."
Moon Carver,"The mind knows its answer. Though one must consult with one's fellows, lest the mind be misguided."
Moon Carver,"Go. Take your Sigil of Permission, carry with you a message."
Traveller:  Who should I look for?
Traveller:  Where should I go?
Moon Carver,Mountain Shaper and Cloud Retainer: can be found here. Only fate will decide if you shall find them — only fate.
Moon Carver,"There exists a Conqueror of Demons, a Guardian Yaksha. Go to Wangshu Inn. There you shall seek him."
Paimon: "Oh, this seems to be Wangshu Inn."
Paimon: Compared to Jueyun Karst this place seems basic. Are we really gonna find an adeptus here?
Paimon: "Let's take a look. Paimon: reckons he'll be on the balcony. Heh, doubt we're going to find him in the kitchen."
Paimon: Oh? He's not here?
Xiao: "To the blind, everything may not be as it appears..."
Xiao: A Sigil of Permission? You came prepared.
Xiao: Though this only prevents me from hurting you myself. Doesn't stop you from getting hurt in other ways.
Paimon: Uhh... Paimon: doesn't get it...
Xiao: Too much contact with our world is breaking the rules.
Xiao: Oh. It's you two.
Paimon: We meet again! Hiya!
Xiao: Why do you insist on getting involved in the world of demons and adepti? You're breaking the rules too often.
Xiao: "Mortal souls are not as robust as those of adepti, nor can your blood carry this level of adeptal energy."
Xiao: It's for your own good. Leave. Now.
Paimon: "Wait a sec, we came here to..."
Paimon: Argh! Paimon:'s... peeved! All he does is think about himself!
Paimon: "Paimon: wants to give him an ugly nickname... but if you tick off an adeptus, the only thing you'll probably ever find in treasure chests is cabbages! Bleurgh!"
Paimon: Ugh... Guess we should go ask the boss lady of the inn about just how she manages to talk to adepti.
Traveller:  Tell me about that adeptus.
Verr Goldet,Oh? You've already met Xiao:?
Verr Goldet,Not bad. Not often he's in a good enough mood to agree to see people.
Paimon: That's his good mood?
Verr Goldet,"Oh yes, the adepti are very hard to come by. Many people go their whole lives praying to them, never once actually getting to see one."
Verr Goldet,"When the Geo Archon built Liyue, he borrowed power from the adepti."
Verr Goldet,But most of them only know how to protect Liyue by fighting.
Verr Goldet,"So for many millennia, it has instead been humans who have led Liyue, whilst the adepti have lived hidden away on the outskirts."
Paimon: "You really know a lot, huh boss lady."
Verr Goldet,"It's not ""boss lady,"" it's just boss..."
Verr Goldet,"Anyway, seen as you have the favor of the adepti, things should be a lot easier."
Verr Goldet,"Well... If you wanna know my opinion... If you keep Xiao: in a good mood, things should be okay."
Paimon: Good mood? Can't really imagine what a "good mood" looks like for that "Vigilant Yaksha."
Verr Goldet,"Haha! Will be interesting, won't it?"
Verr Goldet,"(Come to think of it, I've never seen him smile either...)"
Verr Goldet,"How 'bout this — you go see the chef for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and a plate of whatever it is you are best at making."
Verr Goldet,Almond Tofu is one of the few human foods Xiao: likes. The other dish is up to you.
Paimon: "Up to us, eh...? Traveler, what do you think you're the best at cooking?"
Traveller:  Satisfying Salad I guess?
Paimon: "Really hard to screw that one up, right?"
Traveller:  Perhaps a Maha Manjusaka Hot Pyro Slime?
Paimon: Wow! Never heard of that one! Paimon: wants to try it!
Paimon: "But, if we're gonna be cooking for an adeptus, perhaps the Satisfying Salad would be the safer choice..."
Smiley YanXiao: Can't you see I'm on a break kid? Scram.
Traveller: " Excuse me, we'd like an Almond To—"
Smiley YanXiao: Scram!
Paimon: "Whoa, this chef guy's service is about as good as that Wagner guy's back in Mondstadt."
Traveller: " It's for the boss, Goldet."
Smiley YanXiao: ....
Smiley YanXiao: "I see. If it's for the boss, then guess I don't have a choice now, do I?"
Smiley YanXiao: "But my heart's not really in it right now, not enough to make a dessert as painstaking as Almond Tofu."
Paimon: And why is that?
Smiley YanXiao: "A fencer's hand must be steady, so too must be the hand of a chef."
Smiley YanXiao: "But my hands, I'm.... they're not steady..."
Smiley YanXiao: "Because ahh, a traveler once told me that this inn... is haunted."
Smiley YanXiao: "And then, just now — just now! In the kitchen... I saw something... something not right."
Paimon: "(This chef looks so intimidating, but speak of ghosts and he becomes weak.)"
Smiley YanXiao: I keep thinking... even Wangshu Inn isn't safe. I—I can't keep a steady hand for something like Almond Tofu.
Paimon: "Alright Traveler. In the name of high-quality Almond Tofu, we need to go check this kitchen out."
Verr Goldet,Opportunities to meet an adeptus are rare and fleeting. Make the most of it.
Paimon: Doesn't seem to be anyth—
Paimon: ...
Paimon: ...
Paimon: @&%*!
Smiley YanXiao: What!? You saw it too! There really is a ghost!
Smiley YanXiao: What... How can I...
Paimon: "Okay, so he's useless now. What do we do?"
Paimon: Forget it. Let's just go see the boss lady again.
Verr Goldet,Hehe... Scared of something so insignificant. Hard to believe he was once a notorious bandit.
Paimon: "You don't seem that afraid of ghosts, boss lady."
Verr Goldet,"Gods and ghosts, I've seen it all before."
Paimon: "Come to think of it, others don't seem to know there's an adeptus here at the inn, except for the boss lady..."
Verr Goldet,Shh!
Verr Goldet,Say any more and you'll be divulging my little secret.
Verr Goldet,Right. Before you two be off. Go see to it that little ghost doesn't go scaring anybody else.
Verr Goldet,"Not that I'm ordering you around. It's like the adeptus said, mortal souls are not as robust as those of the adepti."
Verr Goldet,"So as to not be harmed when dealing with the adepti, you can start by practicing with that ghost."
Traveller:  Sounds good.
Paimon: But how should we persuade the ghost?
Traveller:  But how should we persuade the ghost?
Verr Goldet,There is a calligraphy painting in the inn known as the Witness Sigil. It's been in circulation for over a thousand years. Go take a look at it.
Verr Goldet,"Once you have, look for a place outside where you can see the exact same Witness Sigil formation."
Verr Goldet,Ghosts are just another form of life on earth. It's certainly possible to deal with them on their own terms.
Paimon: "Th—There she is! So scary... (Traveler), quick, you... you grab her."
Paimon: She's trying to get away!
Paimon: "We have to follow her. If it's as the boss lady said, she won't disappear like last time!"
Paimon: Argh! She doesn't know when to give up!
Paimon: "This old, decrepit Ruin Guard... Surely it's not... possessed!?"
Dusky Ming,"? Silly-churl, billy-churl ?..."
Paimon: Phew... Finally caught you. Paimon:'s pooped.
Dusky Ming,? Silly-billy hilichurl ?...
Paimon: "Haunting things isn't nice! Little girl, are you listening?"
Dusky Ming,"? Chilly-churl, frilly-churl ?..."
Paimon: Now listen here young lady!
Dusky Ming,...
Dusky Ming,Okay.
Dusky Ming,Dusky Ming won't tease the travelers at the inn anymore.
Dusky Ming,Next time Traveler can come play with Dusky Ming.
Dusky Ming,"If you don't come and play, Dusky Ming will come find you~"
Smiley YanXiao: Wh-What... You really got the ghost to promise to stop haunting the inn?
Smiley YanXiao: Wow... You really are something...
Smiley YanXiao: I am in your debt.
Smiley YanXiao: "Please wait a moment. I'll make you the smoothest, silkiest bowl of Almond Tofu."
Smiley YanXiao: "Haha, my hands are steadier than ever now that she's gone."
Smiley YanXiao: I haven't enjoyed something so much in a long time. That dish was pure perfection.
Xiao: ...You two again.
Paimon: Wait! Don't go disappearing again.
Xiao: What's this?
Paimon: "It's your favorite, Almond Tofu! As well as this distant traveler's best dish — a Satisfying Salad."
Paimon: Traveler! Quick! Tell him everything before he finishes eating!
Xiao: Rex Lapis... How could this be?
Xiao: "I... can't imagine it. Though times have changed, I've never imagined a Liyue without him."
Xiao: The ruling Qixing... Just what role have they played in this?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: "I will seek Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, and Cloud Retainer:. It is time they too made their decisions."
Traveller:  Will the adepti take over his role in Liyue?
Traveller:  Will the adepti interrogate the Qixing?
Xiao: Adepti do not turn on their responsibilities.
Xiao: "I have my reasons to not want to be tainted by the mortal realm, but... responsibilities are responsibilities."
Xiao: Our god is the God of Contracts after all.
Paimon: Wait! Paimon: still has one last question.
Xiao: Hmm?
Paimon: That... Dusky Ming. She's...
Xiao: "When conquering demons, on occasion, you can come across spirits who have never hurt anyone, yet are also not yet able to be moved on."
Xiao: So I asked the innkeeper and the boss if they could keep her here for a time.
Paimon: "So really, Wangshu Inn was looking after her! Really keeping a wide range of business going, huh!"
Li Ding,"Have mercy, O mighty adeptus! I beg you... Show mercy upon me and my brother... Spare our lives!"
Traveller:  What's wrong?
Li Ding,Who are you? What's going on?
Paimon: We asked you first!
Li Ding,...Oh! You enjoy safe passage in Jueyun Karst... It can only mean one thing!
Li Ding,You must be adepti messengers! Sent here to rescue me and my brother!
Paimon: What is he talking about?
Li Ding,"...Oh, have mercy, mighty messengers of the illuminated adepti! I beg you to save us... My brother and I, we only came here because our family is poor, and we heard tell of treasures hidden in the amber of Mt. Hulao."
Li Ding,It was stupid of us... but all we wanted to do was find enough treasure to sell and support our family...
Li Ding,"We followedthe path up the mountain, but suddenly, the amber... it swallowed up my brother, Li Dang!"
Li Ding,"I ran away, and made it this far before it dawned on me. We were trespassers in the abode of the adepti, and this was our punishment…"
Li Ding,"I had no idea how to rescue my brother, so I just started praying for the adepti to have mercy, right here on the spot. And now, at long last, two messengers come to my aid..."
Paimon: "What? We're not adepti messengers... We just wanna find the adepti, like everyone else!"
Li Ding,"No no no, you must be messengers... You have to be!"
Li Ding,"I have no idea which amber trapped him... Please, you have to rescue him! I beg you, show me some adepti mercy!"
Traveller: " Oh, fine. I'll go have a look..."
Li Ding,"Thank you, thank you! O mighty messengers of the illuminated adepti, I promise that we will never be so foolish again..."
Traveller: " Of your transgressions, your predicament, and your repentance, one has become aware."
Li Ding,"Thanks be to the adeptus of Mt. Hulao, and to their messengers! Never will we be so foolish again..."
Paimon: "Whoa, check you out! When you speak like that, you actually make a pretty convincing adepti messenger."
Li Ding,"Please, help me rescue my brother. I don't know which amber it was that took him..."
Li Ding,All I know is that we kept tothe path the whole way up the mountain. So the amber won't be far from the path.
Li Ding,"O mighty messengers of the illuminated adepti, please rescue him, I beg of you..."
Paimon: "Paimon: was gonna ask him about where to find the adeptus, but... he seems pretty one-track-mind about rescuing his brother right now."
Paimon: "Hmm... So, he said that Li Dang got trapped in amber somewhere on Mt. Hulao, and that they were following the path the whole way up."
Paimon: "So, let's follow the path down from here, and make sure to be on the lookout for amber on the way."
Li Dang,*coughing*
Li Dang,Wh–What happened? ...Y–You rescued me? Thank you...
Li Dang,"Oh! And have you seen my brother? His name is Li Ding, we were climbing the mountain together."
Li Dang,I just hope he didn't get trapped in amber too...
Traveller:  He's the one who sent us looking for you.
Li Dang,Phew... so he's safe then...?
Traveller:  He's at the top of the mountain.
Li Dang,He made it to the top? That means he should be okay...
Li Dang,Thank you! I will head up to find my brother now.
Li Dang,Here's hoping I don't run into any more amber on the way...
Li Dang,*coughing*
Li Dang,Wh–What happened? ...Y–You rescued me? Thank you...
Li Dang,"Oh! And have you seen my brother? His name is Li Ding, we were climbing the mountain together."
Li Dang,"But then, I... Well, I don't know. Did I get swallowed up by the amber? I think I must have been knocked out..."
Li Dang,I just hope he didn't get trapped in amber too...
Traveller:  I wouldn't know...
Li Dang,"Alright then, I won't bother you anymore. Thanks again... I'm going to find my brother now."
Li Dang,I really hope he's okay...
Li Ding,"Thank you for rescuing my brother, O mighty messengers of the illuminated adepti."
Traveller:  Have you ever seen the adeptus here?
Li Ding,"What? No... I mean, like everyone else, we've heard that there's an adeptus living in Mt. Hulao."
Li Ding,But regular folks like us would never have the chance to meet them. No way.
Li Ding,"Unlike you guys... You're adepti messengers, so it's a whole different story."
Li Ding,"Anyway, we have trespassed in the realm of the adeptus for long enough. We should get going. Thank you, mighty adepti messengers..."
Li Dang,"Yes, thank you, messengers..."
Paimon: "...Boy, it'd be super helpful if we actually were adepti messengers."
Paimon: 'Cause it seems like this adeptus has got a real temper problem...
Paimon: "But it's not like we've done anything wrong, so... hopefully we'll be okay... hehe..."
Mountain Shaper,Who dares trespass on my mountain? Who is it that frees the thief from his incarceration?
Mountain Shaper,"Foolish mortal, come forth and receive your punishment at once!"
Li Ding,My brother told me everything... Thank you both so much for rescuing him!
Li Ding,"*sigh* Our family has nothing to live on... We heard tell of treasures hidden in the amber of Mt. Hulao, and with nowhere else to turn, we came looking for them."
Li Dang,We weren't thinking straight... We thought we could sneak up into the mountain and grab just enough treasure to sell and support our family with.
Li Dang,"As you can see, the adeptus punished us for our greed. The amber swallowed me up, and if you hadn't come to our rescue, who knows when I would've gotten out."
Li Ding,Luckily the adeptus was merciful. They sent you two as their messengers to save us...
Traveller:  ...Messengers?
Li Ding,"Yes! You two saved my brother, just as I was praying for the adeptus' forgiveness, right here on the top of the mountain."
Li Dang,"You are adepti messengers, no doubt about it."
Traveller: " Of your transgression, your predicament, and your repentance, one has become aware."
Paimon: "Whoa, your adepti messenger impression is really good. It's like this is the part you were born to play!"
Li Ding,"Thank you... yes, we are truly sorry, my brother and I have learned our lesson."
Li Ding,We are truly blessed to receive the mercy of the adeptus. We promise that we will change our ways and make an honest living from now one. Even if it means sweating it out down at the docks.
Li Ding,"Anyway, we have trespassed in the realm of the adeptus for long enough. We should get going. Thank you, mighty adepti messengers..."
Li Dang,"Yes, thank you, messengers..."
Mountain Shaper,"...You intrude upon the sanctity of Mt. Hulao, you destroy the amber of my mountain, and you free a thief whose freedom is not yours to give."
Mountain Shaper,The thieves' ignorance was an affront to the adepti... but your actions are an abomination of the highest order!
Paimon: Wait! We can explain...
Traveller: " Here, look at this..."
Mountain Shaper,...A Sigil of Permission? One was unaware that such things still exist in the mortal realm.
Traveller:  Moon Carver sent us...
Mountain Shaper,Moon Carver... trusted a mere mortal as his messenger?
Mountain Shaper,Is this... a Sigil of Permission? One is surprised to find that such things still exist in the mortal realm.
Mountain Shaper,"In the beginning, Rex Lapis cast them for the mortals with his own hand. Few were made then, and thousands of years on, fewer still remain..."
Mountain Shaper,"Speak. One shall listen to the matter which brings you here, then one shall verify the truth thereof."
Mountain Shaper,"You would be wise to speak the truth, for Liyue is not so far from here that one would be easily deceived."
Mountain Shaper,Rex Lapis... Assassinated?
Mountain Shaper,At the Rite of Descension!?
Mountain Shaper,"What mortal in Liyue– nay, in all the world, would conspire to commit such foul treason? Or perhaps the more pertinent question is, what power in this world could aspire to achieve it?"
Mountain Shaper,"Rex Lapis charged the adepti with the protection of Liyue, and we have always honored this duty. As the people have prospered, so have we gradually withdrawn into the mountains. Indeed, this was a gesture of good will towards humanity."
Mountain Shaper,"But now... Alas! Rex Lapis, gone..."
Mountain Shaper,"Traveler, of the matter you have relayed, one has become aware. One now knows why Moon Carver has sent for us."
Mountain Shaper,"Once one has dealt with certain matters here that require my attention, one shall convene with the other adepti."
Traveller:  Can someone explain the amber situation to me?
Paimon: "Paimon: can! Adepti always have magical powers in storybooks, seems it's true in real life too."
Paimon: "You know, like how grass is actually adepti hair, and rivers are actually adepti saliva... There must be something similar going on with the amber."
Traveller:  So is rain... adepti tears?
Traveller: " Amber must be crystallized adepti... ew, gross."
Mountain Shaper,"...Your nonsense knows no bounds. This amber is produced by a flower that one has planted here, called thekarst crawler."
Mountain Shaper,"The majority of the plant is hidden underground. When stepped on, it produces amber to trap the invader."
Mountain Shaper,"After taking up residence here, one planted many karst crawlers to ensure that the tranquility of the mountain would remain undisturbed. Over the years, they have helped to prevent many disturbances, but in the process they have also trapped many curious things..."
Paimon: "Oh, so the amber is... alive?"
Mountain Shaper,"Correct. Thus, one may not leave this place in its current state, for fear of the risk to innocent lives in one's absence."
Mountain Shaper,One will depart as soon as one has attended to this matter. One trusts that the manner of your departure will be swifter in nature.
Paimon: "Hey, who put this table here? They've even set it ready for dinner, there's a wine jug and everything..."
Paimon: "Ooh, they even have the guests' names carved into the seats! ""Here sits Retainer..."""
Paimon: "Here sitsGuizhong..." "Here sits Rex..."
Paimon: Maybe "Rex" is short for "Rex Lapis"? But Paimon: has no idea about "Guizhong."
Paimon: "As for ""Retainer,"" hmm... That's it! When Moon Carver was going through the names of his adepti buddies, he said there was one called ""Cloud Retainer:."""
Paimon: "So, this must be where Cloud Retainer: and the other adepti have their dinner parties!"
Paimon: "Hehe, how about we cook up some extra-special dishes for the adepti? We're sure to get Cloud Retainer:'s attention that way!"
Paimon: "But... What do adepti even eat, anyway? Paimon: has no idea..."
Paimon: "Hmm, people must make offerings here all the time. Guess all we can do is look around the area for any leftovers, maybe that'll give us some ideas."
Paimon: Do you think maybe it's at all possible that the adepti might like to try some... Sticky Honey Roast?
Paimon: Someone has definitely cooked here before. D'you think they were making an offering?
Paimon: "Looks like they didn't use all the ingredients. Let's see here... we got some Snapdragon, some Lotus Heads, some Tofu... Whatever they were cooking, it sounds complicated!"
Paimon: "Hey, look over there... They left some notes, too."
Paimon: "Yep, it's a doozy! Paimon:'s not surprised they had to write it all down, it's a lot to remember... We should read it carefully."
Paimon: "What would you call a dish that's made from Snapdragon, Lotus Heads, and Tofu? Hmm..."
Paimon: Whoa... The ground is covered in flour. *tsk* What a messy chef...
Paimon: "Hmm, seems there's meat in this pot, but Paimon: can't tell which kind."
Paimon: Do you think whoever cooked this made it as an offering to the adepti?
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon: can't quite imagine an offering made of flour and meat...
Paimon: "Huh? Our messy chef dropped a piece of paper on the floor... Ew, and there's a huge footprint on it too..."
Paimon: "But footprint aside, maybe it has something to do with this mystery dish?"
Paimon: "Paimon:'s so curious, what kind of dish uses only flour and meat?"
Paimon: It's very clean here. Whoever cooked here last obviously likes to keep things neat and tidy...
Paimon: Paimon: bets they were making an offering to the adepti...
Paimon: Looks like we got us some Matsutake and some Raw Meat...
Paimon: "And what do you know, the recipe is right here. This chef was a super organized person..."
Paimon: What do you get if you cross Matsutake and Raw Meat? Hmm...
Cloud Retainer: One senses the presence of a Sigil of Permission...
Cloud Retainer: "One knows not why you have come, though the sincerity of your offering is clear... Hence, you shall be granted an opportunity."
Cloud Retainer: "Find your way through mine abode, and you shall receive an audience with the adeptus whom you seek."
Paimon: "Look, that platform is moving!"
Paimon: So that's what this button is for...
Paimon: There's no way for you to get up there...
Paimon: Where's a wind current when you need one...
Paimon: Paimon: thinks that you're doing this all wrong!
Paimon: Try activating the mechanisms again... but pay more attention this time!
Cloud Retainer: One is most impressed. The path that leads through this abode defies those of ordinary abilities.
Cloud Retainer: "The one before you is the adeptus, Cloud Retainer:. Now, speak of the matter which brings you here."
Traveller: Did you build this whole place?
Cloud Retainer: "You surmise correctly. This place did oneself build, as did one design the mechanisms within."
Traveller: Did you design all those mechanisms?
Cloud Retainer: You surmise correctly.
Cloud Retainer: "In fact, even Guizhong and Rex Lapis themselves found one's technological accomplishments to be worthy of commendation."
Paimon: This place is huge! And there are so many mechanisms... Do you really have this whole place to yourself?
Paimon: What's it even for? Did you build it as your private mechanism workshop or something?
Paimon: "It's just like the stories say. The adepti leave the human world, find somewhere to go be a hermit, and then they research and invent all these amazing things..."
Cloud Retainer: "One is simply not partial to the tedium of social interaction, and wished to find some peace and quiet."
Cloud Retainer: "Find it one did... Shortly after which, you arrived bearing your Sigil of Permission..."
Cloud Retainer: "But enough! State the matter which brings you here, at once! You have disturbed the tranquility of this place for long enough."
Cloud Retainer: Rex Lapis... Assassinated!?
Cloud Retainer: How can this be!? Such a heinous crime... Who would dare?
Cloud Retainer: The notion is so preposterous as to be unbelieveable... one shall have to verify the truth of the matter independently...
Cloud Retainer: "...Perhaps one shall squash Liyue first, then convene with the other adepti–"
Traveller: ...Excuse me!?
Paimon: "Wait, what!? Did you just say ""squash Liyue Harbor""? Are you seriously gonna wipe out the whole city?"
Cloud Retainer: Only a response of sufficient magnitude can negate the possibility of further incidents.
Traveller: But the adepti are sworn to protect the city...
Cloud Retainer: It is as you say. We have protected Liyue Harbor under the leadership of Rex Lapis for 37 centuries. But in the face of this coup by nefarious actors... exceptional measures must be taken.
Traveller: Aren't you supposed to protect the people there?
Cloud Retainer: "It is as you say. But if Rex Lapis has indeed been murdered, then Liyue is in great peril. To delay in quashing the threat is to invite further disaster."
Cloud Retainer: It is precisely because one does not wish to see further suffering that exceptional measures are deemed necessary at this exceptional time.
Paimon: "Yikes! Quick, you gotta think of something! She wants to squash Liyue flat, and it doesn't seem like she's bluffing!"
Traveller: "You accepted our offering, that makes this a contract."
Paimon: "Exactly what Paimon: was gonna say! We made all that delicious food, and gave every last bit of it to you!"
Paimon: We were hoping you might help Liyue out... not wipe Liyue out!
Paimon: "...Or at least let's... y'know, discuss it first? Can't hurt for you to get a second opinion."
Cloud Retainer: "Contract..." A cruel irony that you should appeal to the notion after the merciless murder of the God of Contracts himself.
Cloud Retainer: "The people of Liyue seem quite content to dispense with their contracts. They are quite adept at taking that which is composed of black and white, and turning it gray..."
Cloud Retainer: "Nevertheless... Since you come here in the name of contracts, far be it from one to abandon one's own contractual obligations."
Cloud Retainer: Least of all when you come bearing a Sigil of Permission... *sigh* Rex Lapis infused these sigils with adeptal power when he first cast them. That power once aided humans in battle.
Cloud Retainer: Most of the sigil's power has long since worn off... It is but a keepsake now.
Cloud Retainer: This keepsake cannot be taken as proof of your trustworthiness. One must investigate the claims that you make independently.
Cloud Retainer: "This, no doubt, is Moon Carver's very reason for summoning us."
Cloud Retainer: "Your audience with the adeptus before you is now concluded. Leave at once, and disturb me no further."
Childe:,You've finally returned. How was your journey to Jueyun Karst?
Childe:,...I see.
Childe:,"Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, Cloud Retainer:  Conqueror of Demons..."
Childe:,Some of these names have never come up in the intel the Fatui gets hold of.
Childe:,"As a returning gift, I too have information for you."
Childe:,Regarding the archon's passing... The Liyue Qixing's response really has given me food for thought...
Childe:,"They've announced that, as the true killer has not yet been found, they are not allowing anyone to pay their respects to the Exuvia."
Childe:,"They've even gone so far as to try and cut off information... But with the Rite of Descension and all, even the Qixing isn't able to keep a lid on things."
Paimon: Exuvia?
Childe:,It's common knowledge in Liyue that Rex Lapis is also an adeptus.
Childe:,"The Geo Archon is also the God of Contracts, and is also known as the Exuvia, Prime of the Adepti."
Childe:,The mighty and illuminated adepti of today all signed contracts to protect Liyue back then.
Paimon: Guess that explains why they're all so focused on Liyue's well-being.
Childe:,Naturally. They both have the responsibility and the aptitude for the job.
Childe:,"If the ruling Qixing became unable to perform their duty properly, the adepti have the right to take corrective action."
Childe:,"The Geo Archon's spirit has risen, so why would the Qixing hide his vessel!? Truly suspicious."
Traveller: This makes things difficult for me too.
Traveller: "I agree, something is definitely not right."
Paimon: Oh! Right! He's the whole reason we came here!
Paimon: If the Liyue Qixing has locked up Exuvia and won't let anyone near...
Paimon: Then (Traveler's) quest to find The Seven is already over!
Childe:,"Oh? You're trying to find The Seven? And just why might that be, pray tell?"
Traveller: Nothing to do with you.
Traveller: No comment.
Childe:,Heh... nice answer.
Childe:,"A knight that gets duped by the Fatui would really be no knight at all now, would they?"
Childe:,"But, I can help you with that too you know."
Paimon: Hmm? Really?
Childe:,Give me some time.
Childe:,Time... to find someone.
Childe:,Someone who can help you break through this stalemate.
Childe:,"Truly fascinating. The harder they try to silence the situation, the greater the chaos that erupts..."
Childe:,"If you want to be around to see it all come crashing down, best you stay alive until we next meet, yes?"
Ekaterina,"Welcome,Traveler, friend ofChilde:. And congratulations on the first day of your illustrious career with the Fatui."
Traveller: I don't consider Childe: a friend.
Traveller: I have no intention of joining the Fatui.
Ekaterina,"You sound remarkably sure of yourself... Remember, we are mere mortals — our ideas are fluid like water. Only the Tsaritsa truly has a will as solid as the permafrost."
Ekaterina,But back to the matter at hand. Childe: tells me that he has upheld his end of your agreement.
Paimon: "What agreement? Oh, the thing about him helping us find a guy?"
Ekaterina,Correct. Childe: promised he would find someone to break the stalemate. And the Harbingers do not break their promises lightly.
Paimon: "Ah. Where is that guy, anyway?"
Ekaterina,Childe: is currently atLiuli Pavilion.
Traveller: Liuli Pavilion?
Paimon: "Ooh, ooh Paimon: knows this one!"
Paimon: "*clears throat* There are two styles of cooking in Liyue, known as Li style and Yue style. They have been competing for centuries, but neither has emerged as the clear winner."
Paimon: "The flagship restaurant of the Li style is the Liuli Pavilion. The owner especially chose to open the restaurant at Feiyun Slope, so they could compete face-to-face with the Xinyue Kiosk, which is the flagship restaurant of the Yue style."
Traveller: Trust you to only know these sorts of things...
Traveller: You're like this every time we talk about food...
Paimon: "Don't talk to Paimon: like that! Anyway, Paimon:'s hungry. Let's get moving."
Ekaterina,"Master Childe: awaits you at the Liuli Pavilion. If you please, do not keep him waiting."
Childe:,"Aha, you made it."
Childe:,"As promised, I have found someone who can help you. Someone who can solve the mystery of why the Liyue Qixing would hide the Geo Archon's vessel."
Paimon: So where is he? InLiuli Pavilion?
Childe:,"He certainly is. Come, I'll introduce you."
Childe:,"I took the liberty of setting up a business dinner, as per the Liyue custom."
Hongru,"Welcome back, sir. You honor us with your patronage."
Hongru,Mr. Zhongli: is awaiting your arrival in the room you booked.
Childe:,"Allow me to introduce Mr. Zhongli:  consultant to an organization known as Wangsheng... and a trusted associate of the Fatui."
Traveller: Associate of the Fatui?
Traveller: Wangsheng?
Childe:,Indeed. Wangsheng's line of work can be... sensitive at times. Let's just say they understand when discretion is needed.
Childe:,"And we, the Fatui, have always been glad to do business with friends who walk in the shadows."
Paimon: W–Walk in the shadows?
Zhongli: It is an honor to meet you. I have heard tell of you fromMondstadt.
Paimon: Discretion... shadows... Ah! Is Wangsheng some kind of business involving... "dealing" with people?
Zhongli: "Indeed, it is as you have guessed."
Paimon: Ahh—!
Zhongli: The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor organizes burials. We ensure that those who pass on do so in peace.
Paimon: Eh?
Childe:,"Haha, did you think he was some sort of hired killer?"
Childe:,"The Fatui calls many such people friends, but theWangsheng Funeral Parlordoes no dabble in such business... well, ostensibly."
Traveller: Ostensibly...
Childe:,"Well, they are still— Ah, I shouldn't say too much. In any case, I brought you to meet Mr. Zhongli: because..."
Zhongli: Because I can bring you to see Rex Lapis' vessel.
Paimon: What!?
Childe:,"Ha, don't be so surprised. Sure, the Geo Archon's body has been squirreled away by order of the TianquanNingguang:... but first, let's hear what Mr. Zhongli: has to say, shall we?"
Zhongli: "Rex Lapis may be the Prime ofAdepti, but he is ultimately an adeptus. Many adepti have left us over the millennia — this is the inexorable trend."
Zhongli: The times have changed — you must have felt it too when you were at Jueyun Karst.
Traveller: That's true. The adepti are staying away from Liyue.
Traveller: The Geo Archon is also an adeptus?
Zhongli: "Archons go by many names. The God of Contracts, the God of Commerce, the Warrior God, Morax, Rex Lapis... is the idea that he also has the title of Adeptus so strange?"
Zhongli: "As you have seen, the time of the adepti is ending, and the time of mankind is slowly dawning."
Zhongli: "In years past, Liyue's tradition was that a huge memorial service be held to mark the passing of every adeptus. But this time, the Qixing have made no attempt whatsoever to respect this tradition. It is sacrilege."
Traveller: "Well, they do have a deicide to deal with..."
Paimon: "Yeah, the killer hasn't even been caught yet."
Zhongli: "Deicide or not, the concern of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is this.  When the ritual to receive this god is so kingly, it is all the more egregious for his final send-off to go unattended to."
Zhongli: "Traveler, Childe: has told me a lot about you. Since you have had dealings with the Anemo Archon, could I ask you to help me prepare the Geo Archon's last rites?"
Traveller: I'm going to have to think about it...
Paimon: "Well, if you think about it, (Traveler), we don't have any other choice..."
Childe:,"Indeed, no amount of consideration can change this outcome."
Traveller: I accept your invitation...
Childe:,A wise decision.
Traveller: Childe: says too much.
Childe:,"Oh? In our line of work, that means you want to silence me... How interesting. Draw your sword. We shall—"
Childe:,"Just kidding. Let's continue, shall we?"
Childe:,"The Tianquan, Ningguang:  has forbidden anyone from accessing Rex Lapis' vessel... Which of course you would need to access if you are to achieve your goal of meeting all of The Seven."
Zhongli: Precisely. Only by participating in the Rite of Parting will you be able to see the form of Rex Lapis again.
Traveller: Looks like there's no other choice.
Zhongli: "If we are agreed, come with me. We will speak of the details as we walk."
Childe:,"Alright, my bridge-building work here is done. Turned out well, didn't it?"
Childe:,"You can go if you want to, don't worry about me. I might just have a few more drinks... and get acquainted with these things they call ""chopsticks"" in the meantime."
Childe:,My... chopsticks... truly are difficult to use...
Zhongli: "After having experienced the land of the absentee archon, Traveler, how does it feel to know that our archon and adepti are here all around you in Liyue?"
Traveller: I prefer the atmosphere in Mondstadt.
Zhongli: "I see, so you're that sort of person. It's not a bad thing."
Zhongli: But I suppose you have yet to experience the substance of Liyue's three thousand and seven hundred years of divinity.
Traveller: Liyue is the better place.
Zhongli: Indeed. The weight of three thousand and seven hundred years' worth of history runs deepest in the true divinity of Liyue.
Zhongli: Organizing the Rite of Parting should prove to be an enlightening part of your travels.
Zhongli: "Liyue is the most prosperous of the seven nations, defended by deities and ruled by the Qixing. As such, the diplomatic maneuverings of the Fatui have gained no purchase here."
Zhongli: Ningguang: of the Qixing has always been on her guard against the Fatui. That is in all likelihood why Childe: wants to make use of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's connections.
Paimon: Huh... what would Childe: get out of us doing the Rite of Parting anyway?
Zhongli: "I neither know nor do I wish to know. As far as I am concerned, the Fatui are merely financial sponsors. I only wish for Liyue's traditions to endure."
Zhongli: "These are the advance funds that Childe: has provided. If you use them up, you can go to him to apply for any subsequent funding."
Paimon: Wow...
Zhongli: "Well then, let us be off. The first step in our preparations shall be to obtain some prizeNoctilucous Jadeworthy of a deity."
Shitou,"Welcome to the Jade Mystery, my good friends! Would you like to try your luck betting on jade? This could be your lucky day."
Shitou,"It's cheap and it's fun, and who knows, you might just strike it rich!"
Paimon: "Betting? No, no, we're here for... um, what was it again?"
Zhongli: "Noctilucous Jade, of radiant grade at the very least."
Shitou,"Radiant grade Noctilucous Jade? I see, you're not a tourist. My apologies. I have some here for your perusal..."
Shitou,"What do you think? The Jade Mystery is an old name in the jade business. Just look at that wonderful quality! Rex Lapis doesn't often bless us with such finery. Go on, pick whichever one you like!"
Paimon: "These three pieces really do look pretty, not like the ones you usually dig up..."
Paimon: But how do we pick? Should we just grab one and go?
Traveller: A man who makes his living off betting on stones can't be trusted so lightly.
Zhongli: Very good. It seems you have learned some tricks of the trade.
Paimon: "What do you think, Mr. Zhongli:? How should we pick from these pieces of Noctilucous Jade?"
Traveller: "What do you think, Mr. Zhongli:?"
Zhongli: Oh? You want me to decide? That is fine as well.
Zhongli: "If it were me, the answer would be simple."
Paimon: Oh? And that would be...?
Zhongli: "I'll take them all, boss."
Shitou,"Oh, you act with such panache, good sir! I always knew you were not a man of ordinary caliber!"
Paimon: "Wait! Wait! Boss, that one didn't count! We need to discuss it again!"
Paimon: "Hey! If we only need one for the ritual, aren't we wasting three times the Mora if we buy them all!?"
Traveller: That's true.
Traveller: "Actually, it's two times more Mora."
Zhongli: "Oh, Mora. Hmm..."
Zhongli: It is as you say. I suppose I overlooked this particular aspect of the transaction.
Paimon: Huh? How do you not think about Mora when buying things!?
Zhongli: "If one must always consider Mora before acting, then in all things one is bound by Mora."
Paimon: Ahh... What?
Zhongli: "All Mora is currency, but not all currency is Mora."
Paimon: ???
Traveller: He's talking about economics.
Paimon: Is this how the rich live?
Paimon: "Well, he knows a lot about big money, but not a lot about big savings."
Traveller: Sounds like he's loaded.
Paimon: So loaded that he doesn't even bother hunting for a bargain.
Zhongli: "No need to waver. Even when I am constrained by Mora, I have ways of working around my limitations."
Zhongli: "Evaluating the quality of Noctilucous Jade is indeed very tricky. As crude ore, there is little difference in texture, lustrousness, and internal pattern between good and bad jade."
Zhongli: "Only after the item made using Noctilucous Jade has taken shape, will you be able to see whether it is up to par or not."
Zhongli: "If you return to those crafty merchants to quibble, they will counter by saying that your crafting bench is to blame, or that your heat control was poor."
Paimon: Whoa! To think it's that easy to get cheated...
Zhongli: "But there is a way to truly evaluate this jade, and a true insider would know it."
Zhongli: "A fool sees the pointer and misses the moon."
Paimon: What does that mean?
Zhongli: "If you point at the moon with your finger, a wise man knows that you are pointing at the moon, while a fool will only see the finger."
Zhongli: "The patterns, the facade, these are all the ""finger."" Noctilucous Jade is a mystical stone used to light up the darkness, and so its brightness is the most important thing — it is the ""moon."""
Zhongli: "Noctilucous Jade of excellent quality would have superior Pyro affinity. In other words, the bluer and brighter the luster of the ore under high temperature, the higher its quality."
Traveller: I didn't realize you were such an expert...
Traveller: Is this normal life for a high-class gentleman?
Zhongli: I have imparted the priceless secrets of the jade trade to you. Now all that's left is to put it into practice.
Paimon: "Priceless, huh... Paimon:'s just sad that we might never be able to use it again..."
Paimon: "We're back to buy some rocks, boss. But can you let us burn them first?"
Shitou,"B–burn them? You can't do that, my friends! If you were to do so, what would I have to sell?"
Traveller: "Then, can we get some small samples?"
Shitou,"That... Well, fine. As you wish, then."
Traveller: Then I'm not buying any.
Shitou,"Not buying...? Ah, come, come now, my good friends... we can still discuss this. Negotiation is key to trade, wouldn't you say?"
Shitou,How about this? I can take a small sample of all three. I'll take a bit of a loss — we'll count it as a friendly gesture.
Zhongli: "Don't worry, I know the rules. As long as we can prove that it is good jade, you will not take a loss."
Shitou,Alright. Take these as samples. I've carved them off with a knife and tagged them to boot.
Traveller: These samples...
Traveller: So thin...
Paimon: ...Aren't these too thin?
Paimon: "Even paper's thicker. No, even a bug's wings are thicker! These are almost see-through!"
Traveller: How stingy...
Shitou,"Stingy? I've already been very generous. Any more, and you may as well have my neck!"
Traveller: This is impressive handiwork.
Shitou,"Hahaha. You flatter me, but I have to be gentle with these rocks. They are my pride and joy!"
Shitou,"If I'd taken off even a bit more, it would have killed me."
Paimon: But wouldn't something this thin go poof if we held it to the fire?
Zhongli: "It can't be helped. Trying to deprive a merchant of his profits would be like forcing a ravenous wolf to vomit up the food in its stomach. Nonetheless, under the right conditions, these thin slices will serve."
Paimon: What sort of conditions?
Zhongli: "While we add the high temperatures using Pyro, we can use Hydro to reinforce it from within. This way, the samples will not disintegrate immediately."
Shitou,"Oh? Oh, sir, to think you were this learned... Thank you for your understanding!"
Zhongli: "Strictly speaking, asking for samples when we have not yet agreed to purchase the goods is unfair. Trade in Liyue must be based upon fairness."
Paimon: "Well, guess we just need to find a place to try this out..."
Traveller: I remember this spot in the Dadaupa Gorge...
Traveller: How about the kitchen atXiangling's place...
Paimon: You mean atWanmin Restaurant? As long as we do it when she's not in...
Zhongli: That would not do. It is a place where people come and go. They would be endangered if the elemental reaction were to get out of control... We cannot take such a risk.
Paimon: "Ooh! Paimon: remembers! We once saw thisbiiiiig potdown at theDadaupa Gorge, in the camp of the hilichurls from the Meaty Tribe! It's real sturdy, and should be able to take the elemental reactions!"
Paimon: "(Traveler), now, let's pack those samples up and make a move!"
Shitou,How is it? Anywhere near reaching a decision?
Zhongli: It has been a long time since I last set foot in the nation of wind.
Zhongli: A friend of mine from Mondstadt would always bring a few bottles of locally brewed dandelion wine whenever he came to visit me in Liyue.
Zhongli: It must be said that the famed liquor of the Land of Pastorals is far better than Sumeru's frigid snake wine.
Paimon: That's the pot! It looks like the hilichurls are still using it.
Paimon: "It's a bit impolite, but we gotta cut the line."
Paimon: There's still soup in here. These hilichurls sure have big appetites!
Traveller: "Well, it's our lab now."
Traveller: Shame to let it go to waste...
Paimon: This soup looks like it could be used as our Hydro elemental protection. Let's fire it up and begin our experiment!
Paimon: We're ready to go! Paimon: will help remember which one of the three is which!
Paimon: "UsePyroto keep making the pot hotter, until we get the results we need."
Paimon: "Mr. Zhongli: said that theshinier and bluerthe ore gets, the better it is, so pay close attention!"
Paimon: Whoa! That light came from the first Noctilucous Jade!
Paimon: Hilichurls are surrounding us again! Were they attracted by the light?
Paimon: Such nosy neighbors! Let's take care of them and continue again after!
Paimon: "That light came from the second Noctilucous Jade, didn't it?"
Paimon: "More hilichurls! They don't give up, do they?"
Paimon: Looks like they're mad that we ruined their food.
Paimon: "Ow! That's bright! Too bright! That was the third Noctilucous Jade, wasn't it?"
Paimon: It was so much shinier than the rest. Let's go with that one!
Paimon: "(Traveler), let's head back to The Jade Mystery to buy some jade, shall we?"
Shitou,"You're back, my friends! I've kept the goods for you. Which of them would you like?"
Traveller: I would like the first Noctilucous Jade.
Traveller: I would like the second Noctilucous Jade.
Paimon: "Huh? No, it wasn't that one, Paimon: remembers that it wasn't very bright."
Paimon: Think a bit harder...
Traveller: I would like the third Noctilucous Jade.
Paimon: "Exactly, that's the one Paimon: remembers too!"
Shitou,"No problem. If you have your eye on this one, you can have it."
Zhongli: Then we'll take a box of the third type of jade.
Shitou,Done!
Shitou,"All the same... Pardon me for asking, but I'm curious. Whatever do you need this much top-quality Noctilucous Jade for?"
Zhongli: Hmm. I suppose it would not hurt to tell you. We need them to make implements for the Rite of Parting.
Shitou,Parting...!? Oh dear... I'd heard the rumors but hadn't given much thought to them. This... this means thatRex Lapisreally is...
Shitou,"...It's hard to believe. Even though the Jade Mystery has been in decline, we have always been under his protection."
Shitou,"It is said that when our Lord lost his way while going incognito in the city two hundred years ago, it was a spoon from The Jade Mystery that he had used to sample the local delights."
Shitou,"Alas, alas, all things must pass... Well, if this is to be used to say farewell to Rex Lapis, then I shall sell this to you at half the price."
Paimon: Are you sure? You didn't wanna even give us an inch before...
Shitou,"If not for our Lord's protection, this city wouldn't exist as it does now. No proprietor could earn money off such a thing."
Paimon: "Aww... I'm sure Rex Lapis will feel your sentiment, boss."
Zhongli: "In the safe hands of theLiyue Qixingand good, honest merchants such as yourself, I, for one, believe that Liyue will continue to prosper as it always has done."
Traveller: So let's not get ourselves down just yet.
Shitou,"Alright... thank you, my friends. Hah, what's with me, getting all sentimental like this? I'll practically be giving away all my fortune at this rate."
Zhongli: "Now that we've made our choice, let's take this Noctilucous Jade back."
Paimon: "Hey, wait a minute! He said it was half price, not that we could leave without paying!"
Zhongli: "Oh, right, I'm sorry. I must have forgotten to do that too. Let me see..."
Zhongli: "...As I thought, I didn't bring any."
Paimon: Any what?
Zhongli: "Mora. My apologies, another oversight on my part."
Traveller: What a strange take on the value of money...
Traveller: A local of Liyue who doesn't have money on their mind...
Paimon: "That won't do, this isn't some small sum... Oh wait, didn't Childe: give us some advance funds earlier?"
Traveller: I have them on me.
Paimon: "Phew! Have a look, boss, is it enough?"
Shitou,"It's fine, just enough for half price... though to be honest, it'd be alright even if the sum wasn't quite enough."
Zhongli: "Well, it's settled, then. Let's take this jade to Yujing Terrace. That's where we plan to hold the Rite..."
Paimon: "Look at you, bossing everyone around! You didn't cough up a single Mora!"
Traveller: Please remember to bring money next time.
Zhongli: I will do my best. You have my thanks.
Traveller: Guess we need to find Childe: for more funding.
Zhongli: "Mm, it seems that we must. I will keep that in mind. Thanks, both of you."
Shitou,Ah... Rex Lapis... Rex Lapis...
Zhongli: We can leave the jade here. I have already called for a jewelsmith to shape them into the implements that we will need.
Zhongli: "Ah, yes. I have yet to go and see Childe:. So as for the jewelsmith's remuneration..."
Traveller: We'll pay the jewelsmith when he arrives.
Traveller: Fingers crossed Childe: will reimburse us...
Paimon: "Guess we can't do anything else. Also, is this where we're doing the Rite of Parting?"
Zhongli: "Yes. I have already rented this location, and have begun making preparations for the rite."
Traveller: "The Rite of Descension took place here, too."
Zhongli: That's right. The Liyue Qixing have acquiesced to using the same location.
Traveller: So we're just using the scene of the crime to...
Zhongli: The Liyue Qixing have agreed to this arrangement.
Paimon: But when something this big happened here... should suspects like us really be at the crime scene? We might get caught by the Millelith.
Paimon: "Although with that said, since we got back from Jueyun Karst, none of those pesky Millelith soldiers have come chasing after us. Wonder what that's about..."
Paimon: "Also, the, uh, Rex Lapis' vessel..."
Zhongli: "Traditionally, we call it the Exuvia."
Paimon: "Ah, right. That's what it was called! You seem to know everything, Mr. Zhongli:. Um, so, was this Exuvia hidden away by the Qixing? I mean, we haven't even figured out who the murderer is..."
Zhongli: One must think that they already have someone in mind. Or perhaps they already know. Surely they must have found all the evidence that there is to find here.
Traveller: It still feels very odd.
Traveller: Seems a bit too easy-going...
Zhongli: These things are for the authorities in Yujing Terrace to consider. Trying to help would probably only add to their troubles.
Zhongli: "Before the Rite is conducted, the Exuvia will be kept temporarily in theGolden House."
Paimon: Golden House?
Zhongli: The only mint in Liyue... which is to say the only mint inTeyvat. All the Mora that flows throughout the world is minted there.
Paimon: Wow—
Paimon: "No, Paimon: wasn't thinking about anything bad. Paimon: thinks it suits Morax."
Paimon: "But why do you know this, Mr. Zhongli:?"
Zhongli: "Since the Rite of Parting has the approval of the Qixing, it is a semi-official event. As such, there is already some limited information available."
Traveller: "The Qixing provide the location, and Childe: the funds..."
Traveller: They must have some ulterior motive...
Zhongli: Perhaps each has their motives... but this is the capital of commerce. A little exploitation once in a while is not unacceptable.
Zhongli: "In Liyue, where the God of Contracts reigns, only contracts may not be betrayed. I for one have no issue with little maneuvers outside their remit."
Zhongli: "Well then, we should go and prepare theperfumesused in the Rite."
Paimon: Perfumes? Where'll we get those? Do we buy them?
Zhongli: "No, perfumes used to honor the gods must be freshly decocted. The quality of theSilk Flowerswe require is also special."
Zhongli: "Silk Flower petals contain a fibrous material of good quality, often used in brocade-making. Its scent, however, is most elegant, and is especially suited for solemn events like giving offerings to gods and adepti."
Paimon: It's time for Zhongli:'s lectures on high society again...
Zhongli: "We shall not speak of the details right now. Follow me, we shall go to the merchants to purchase our ingredients."
Paimon: Hey boss. Do you sell Silk Flowers here?
Bolai,Silk Flowers? We certainly do! Which kind would you like?
Paimon: "Which kind...? The, uh... the good kind. The best kind. ...Remind Paimon: what kinds there are again?"
Bolai,"Ugh. You ignorant shoppers, always coming in here with your stupid questions..."
Zhongli: "Golden House Maiden, Valley Weaver, and Fate's Yearning. One of each to start with, if you don't mind."
Bolai,...My goodness! This gentleman is quite the connoisseur!
Bolai,You two must be his servants. Please refrain from any further attempts to contribute.
Traveller: "Well, guess I had it coming..."
Traveller: This is what I get for calling Paimon: "emergency food."
Traveller: Wait... You don't even recognize me!?(Unlocked by completingBookworm Swordsman)
Bolai,"I'm sorry? Ah, yes... We've met before, haven't we? Sorry, Traveler, I shouldn't have spoken to you in that tone."
Bolai,Now then... Please peruse at your leisure. Do let me know if you have any further thoughts.
Zhongli: "Silk Flowers exhibit different properties based on how their environmental conditions differ from their ancestral habitat... Nevertheless, these are fine specimens. Excellently preserved."
Zhongli: "Just look at the abundant foliage here. And these stamens, glamorous as a maiden of the Golden House. This strain is an evergreen, and mostly grows under complex hydrological conditions."
Zhongli: "By contrast, this variety thrives in any dark, damp location, often in large clusters. Morphologically, it is distinguished by the profusion of petals and densely packed stamens, though its powerful scent gives it away just as easily."
Zhongli: "Lastly, this strain is quite the recluse. Unlike its exuberant cousins, flowers and foliage are minimal, and when in season, it has a subtle yet enduring scent. It was first discovered by the ancients when they scaled the mountains in search of theadepti."
Zhongli: "Silk Flowers have all but disappeared from the wild today, due to geographical changes over Liyue's history. Most are now grown by horticulturalists."
Bolai,Wow. A true connoisseur. Most of that was news even to me!
Zhongli: I possess but a smattering of trivial knowledge. My traveler friend is the one to watch — they are on track to set foot in every corner of the world.
Traveller: What's so impressive about that...
Traveller: I'm still an ignoramus on horticulture...
Paimon: "Mr. Zhongli:  you're way too humble... So which Silk Flower did you want, anyway?"
Zhongli: "I'll take them all, boss."
Paimon: ...Again!?
Zhongli: "How can I put this... When purchasing opera tickets, it is natural to decide based on which singer has the most melodious voice. The same logic applies when purchasing a pet bird."
Zhongli: But this Silk Flower purchase is not an analogous case. The same logic does not apply.
Zhongli: Perhaps you don't know. Tradition states that we should decoct perfume from different sub-species of Silk Flower when making an offering to a Statue of The Seven.Rex Lapiswill then make his own choice between the scents.
Zhongli: "Like several other tedious and complicated traditions, this one has become simplified over time."
Zhongli: "But this is the only Rite of Parting to take place for one of The Seven in three thousand seven hundred years. As such, I do think we should honor tradition down to the last detail in this case."
Zhongli: "Now that's settled, a question... Ahem. Do you have any Mora on you?"
Paimon: "You forgot to bring money again!? Grr, Zhongli:!!!"
Traveller: I see a pattern emerging here.
Traveller: "By this point, I'd be more surprised if he'd remembered."
Bolai,If I may interject... Did I hear you say that these flowers are to be an offering to the Lord of Geo himself?
Paimon: Yes... in a sense.
Bolai,"Gosh. Well, why didn't you say so? I heard the awful news about what happened at this year's Rite of Descension..."
Bolai,It would be bad luck to say it out loud. But I've been worried about our dear Lord ever since... I'm worried that everything I've heard is true...
Bolai,"Since these flowers will be used to glorify our Lord, they're free of charge. Just don't forget to pass on my regards."
Paimon: Are you serious?
Bolai,Why wouldn't I be? I would be nobody if not for Rex Lapis!
Bolai,"If he hadn't written those poems in praise of my wares, they'd only be worth a fraction of what I can sell them for today..."
Paimon: Huh... So much folklore here revolves around Liyue's deity making cameo appearances in support of local businesses...
Zhongli: "...Thank you, boss. I think I speak for all of us when I say that your generosity has saved our skins."
Paimon: "Our" skins? You were the one who forgot to bring money!
Bolai,Please. It's the least I could do.
Paimon: "So now that we've got the flowers, how do we make the perfume?"
Zhongli: "Ideally, with the help of an expert. Unfortunately, none of my acquaintances have personal experience in the art of decoction..."
Paimon: Talk about first-world problems...
Zhongli: "Hence, I need you to help by asking around in the city. Try the common folk, especially women."
Paimon: So this time we get to go around town looking for nice-smelling ladies to talk to? Paimon: likes this job!
Zhongli: I will wait for you near the Statue of The Seven. Meet me there when the perfume is ready.
Paimon: Maybe we can find some good candidates at the Adventurers' Guild?
Paimon: "Let's askLan. She's master of the Liyue branch, right?"
Bolai,"May the rumors be false, and Rex Lapis be well..."
Paimon: Lan! We need to ask you for a favor...
Lan,"I stopped accepting commissions along time ago. Sorry, you two, but you'll just have to ask another adventurer."
Paimon: "Oh, it's not that kind of favor. It's just a teeny-tiny thing..."
Traveller: Do you know how to make perfume?
Lan,...Wow. Just wow.
Lan,Do I look like the kind of girl who wears perfume to you? I think you're underestimating the kind of person I am...
Traveller: You smell great.
Lan,...Wow. Just wow.
Lan,I am just going to assume that you are either joking or being sarcastic.
Lan,"To be fair, I put a lot of effort into my appearance for someone who spends all their time in the great outdoors. But ""I smell great""? Don't be ridiculous."
Paimon: "Well, Paimon: thinks you smell amazing! So come on Lan, what's your secret? If not perfume?"
Lan,"Now that you mention it... Yes, there is something. What is that scent?"
Lan,"Oh, it must be from theQingxinflowers I picked on the way back. I forgot I still had them with me..."
Paimon: "Aha! The truth is out, Lan's got a soft spot for wildflowers!"
Lan,"Ahh... No, they were for medicinal use only."
Lan,"Anyway, this is a pointless conversation. If you want to know about perfume, try talking toQiming."
Paimon: "The fortune teller, right? Paimon: remembers she smells pretty good!"
Paimon: "Thanks, Lan! See you around~"
Lan,Oh? Not going to look for Qiming yet?
Qiming,Hello. How may I help?
Paimon: We've come to ask you a question...
Traveller: Do you know how to make perfume?
Qiming,"Perfume? I rarely think to use it, let alone about how to make it myself."
Traveller: You smell great.
Qiming,Ah... I...
Qiming,"...Sorry, you caught me off guard. Most people aren't so direct."
Qiming,I think we need more time to get to know each other...
Paimon: Uh... We just wanted to know what perfume you normally use.
Qiming,Oh... Ahem. Well. I don't actually use any.
Qiming,"That said, some of the cosmetics I use are scented. Perhaps that's the cause of this confusion."
Qiming,"Since I usually set up my stall by the docks, I avoid perfume like the plague. BecauseCelestiaforbid those lusty sailors catch a whiff and come hunting for the source!"
Paimon: That's the worst thing Paimon:'s heard all day.
Qiming,"While we're on the subject, have you never heard anyone mention Ying'er's homemade perfume?"
Paimon: "Ying'er... Oh, as inScent of SpringYing'er?"
Qiming,"Yes, that's her. Many a rich family's daughter has gotten her to make perfume for them. Apparently, her homemade product is better than anything you'll find on the market."
Paimon: "Great, this is just the intel we need! Finally, we're getting somewhere."
Qiming,"If you have the time, come and have your fortune told down by the harbor. I'll give you a special price."
Ying'er,Well hello... You found me at last. I've been waiting for you.
Paimon: What? How did you know we were coming?
Ying'er,"Oh, I heard a rumor about a couple who were snooping around town looking for a sweet-smelling lady..."
Ying'er,"Actually, I was starting to worry you wouldn't find me. This is the ultimate test of my appeal, after all..."
Paimon: "Snooping around"? Why are you making it out like we're bad people?
Ying'er,What can I say? People love to talk... Maybe you ought to be more discreet in the future if you don't want word to get around.
Ying'er,"Relax... I know what you're here. You want to get your hands on my homemade perfume, don't you? What kind would you like?"
Traveller: A bespoke triple-Silk-flower variety...
Traveller: Whichever one you're wearing.
Ying'er,"Heh... I'm not wearing any, darling."
Ying'er,"Could it be that you've been bewitched by my natural scent? If so, I'm afraid it's one of a kind..."
Paimon: "Whatever this is, you need to snap out of it right now! (Traveler), Hand her the Silk Flowers!"
Ying'er,Three in one go... My goodness.
Ying'er,"You have extreme tastes for someone your age. Maybe the rumors I heard were true after all. You're on the prowl and need some sweet-smelling ammunition, is that it?"
Traveller: It's for Rex Lapis.
Ying'er,"Tsk... Is that the best you could come up with? Even if you were genuinely offering perfume to a deity, that doesn't explain why you'd need three kinds. Sorry, you story just doesn't hold water!"
Paimon: Zhongli: was right... People don't remember this tradition anymore.
Traveller: You got a problem with that?
Ying'er,"Ay yai yai, who let this tiger out of the cage!? Well, with your looks, who can blame you? If you've got it, flaunt it."
Ying'er,"As one of my favorite poems goes, ""Oh, cherry tree, begrudge not thy blossoms as they are deflowered in the spring, for come winter, even thy sturdiest wood shall wither."""
Paimon: That went over Paimon:'s head a little...
Ying'er,"In short, I'm happy to help. Traveler, you can be my assistant. But you'd better make sure I'm the only person on your mind while you're handing around with me."
Traveller: Okay...
Ying'er,"So... Where is a good place for making sweet, sweet perfume?"
Traveller: Dadaupa Gorge!
Ying'er,"Where is that? Mondstadt? We're only making some perfume, there's not need to go to such ridiculous lengths."
Ying'er,Somewhere closer to home will do. Let's go for the kitchen at theWanmin Restaurant.
Traveller: How about the kitchen at Xiangling's place...
Ying'er,You meanWanmin Restaurant? Good choice! Let's go.
Ying'er,I've had a word withChef Mao. We can start work now.
Ying'er,Are you ready to please me?
Paimon: ...What did you say?
Ying'er,I meant make me proud. As my assistant. Obviously.
Ying'er,"While I'm setting up, you can go and fetch some water."
Ying'er,Have you fetched the water? ...No?
Ying'er,"Have a lookbehind Wanmin Restaurant. Chef Mao is a professional chef, he must keep a store of pure water."
Ying'er,This water will do nicely.
Ying'er,"Now, I need you to extract the Silk Flower essence using a crafting bench."
Ying'er,"Perfume-making uses an altogether different technique from alchemy. Here, let me teach you. Very carefully, take hold of the mortar and pestle... Gently does it..."
Ying'er,You need to keep your wrist firm so your hand doesn't slip...
Ying'er,"Now, use your strong hand to stir it with a persistent rhythm... Keep going until the juices start to come out..."
Traveller: "Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."
Traveller: "Okay, okay, I get it..."
Ying'er,Ooh... You're a natural! Like a fish to water.
Ying'er,"Now, take these and try it out on your own using a nearbycrafting bench."
Ying'er,"Don't forget to do all three. They look visually identical during the essence extraction process, but I will put them into separate containers when the perfume is ready."
Ying'er,"Well, aren't you going to try it out? Has the crafting bench broken?"
Ying'er,Or would you prefer some... hands-on guidance for your first time...?
Ying'er,"Wow, this is some exquisite Silk Flower Essence. Onto the next stage, the most important one of all..."
Ying'er,The essence is placed into water and simmered over low heat until most of the water has boiled off.
Ying'er,"You must take care to control the heat during this process. If the temperature goes too high, it will affect the scent."
Ying'er,"So please, focus on controlling the heat. This is the final step."
Ying'er,"Don't waste a drop of that essence, now. We want all of it in there."
Ying'er,"All three perfumes are ready. And you, my friend, were a wonderful assistant."
Ying'er,A testament to the lengths you will go for romance... It's so rare to see nowadays.
Traveller: "I told you, it's not like that..."
Traveller: I was thinking of you the whole time.
Ying'er,"Wow, you actually remembered my throwaway comment..."
Ying'er,"Y'know, you're cuter than people give you credit for. If I didn't have my guard up, I can see how easily one could be taken in..."
Ying'er,Anyway... Shall I give you a brief overview of each scent? It might just help you match the right scent to the right occasion...
Paimon: Paimon: wants to hear this!
Ying'er,"This first one is sweet as candy, straight out of a fairy tale... Younger women will love it."
Ying'er,The second one is for those with refined tastes... The first choice for daughters of high society.
Ying'er,"Finally, the third one has a soft by lingering scent, like a mist that captures the last light of dusk. Mature women adore this one."
Ying'er,"All clear? Don't get them mixed up now, you'll ruin the mood..."
Traveller: I... I think I got it...
Ying'er,"Good. Be sure to come visit if you ever need help with anything, okay?"
Ying'er,I'll leave you with some parting words
Ying'er,One who tries to sail three boats simultaneously should be careful not to go overboard.
Traveller: ...
Ying'er,"Heh. Come and hang out with me at Scent of Spring sometime, okay?"
Paimon: Let's take these three perfumes over to theStatue of the Seven. Mr. Zhongli:'s probably been waiting for a while.
Paimon: "We've brought the perfumes, Mr. Zhongli:!"
Paimon: Did we take too long? You were just staring up at the statue...
Zhongli: "Oh, you're back. Don't worry, I haven't waited long."
Zhongli: "Compared to the watch that Rex Lapis' statues have kept over Liyue, this was but a brief moment."
Paimon: "Haha, well, how can a person compete with a statue?"
Zhongli: "That is true. Well, have you brought the perfumes?"
Paimon: Three sets and not one less!
Zhongli: Thank you both. Let us offer them up.
Traveller: Offer Golden House Maiden
Paimon: "This is the first kind of perfume. Ms. Ying'er said that it's sweet as a dream, and it's liked by younger ladies."
Traveller: Offer Valley Weaver
Paimon: "This is the second kind. It's got an elegant smell, and the daughters of high society love it!"
Traveller: Offer Fate's Yearning
Paimon: "The third kind has a gentle but lingering fragrance, something something like the dusk mist, and it's a favorite of mature ladies."
Paimon: Oh... what was that?
Traveller: Looks like Rex Lapis really likes this one.
Traveller: I guess the final answer is number three.
Paimon: "That's the one older ladies like, right?"
Paimon: Does that mean that Rex Lapis is actually an older lady?
Zhongli: "Haha, perhaps, perhaps."
Zhongli: Rex Lapis has taken on countless forms. Perhaps that really was one of them.
Paimon: "What a shame, we only got to see the giant dragon form, and..."
Paimon: Let's hope the Qixing can catch the real killer.
Zhongli: We can leave that to the authorities. Let us focus on the fond farewell for Rex Lapis.
Traveller: (What ulterior motives do Childe: and the Qixing have...)
Traveller: "(Well, we do need to see the Exuvia...)"
Paimon: "So, we've finished another step in our preparations. What's next?"
Zhongli: "Next, I would like the two of you to help me borrow theCleansing Bell."
Paimon: Cleansing Bell?
Zhongli: "At present, a friend of mine named Madame Ping is the guardian of the Cleansing Bell. She lives near Yujing Terrace. If you ask her, she will know what to do."
Paimon: "Sure, but... aren't you going to come with us?"
Zhongli: "Ah, I have certain reasons why I cannot be there in person. Please do this for me."
Paimon: "Man, why's he got to be so secretive this time?"
Zhongli: "I apologize, but I won't be able to come with you this time."
Zhongli: "Once you've acquired the Cleansing Bell, meet me atYujing Terrace."
Madame Ping,All things must change...
Traveller: How do you do?
Madame Ping,"Mm? Youngster, are you here to admire the flowers?"
Madame Ping,But it's a shame. TheseGlaze Lilieshave almost all wilted...
Traveller: Are you alright?
Madame Ping,"It's nothing, it's nothing. I just thought it a great shame that so many of these Glaze Lilies have wilted."
Paimon: What happened to them?
Madame Ping,"Back in my day, people said that Glaze Lilies can read human hearts."
Madame Ping,"If they heard beautiful sounds like laughter and singing, they would also bloom joyfully."
Madame Ping,"But if they heard too much wild gossip or slander, they would quickly wither away."
Paimon: ...So that means these flowers feel what's happening inLiyue.
Madame Ping,"Yes, the rumors ofRex Lapis' death are no small matter. They are everywhere."
Madame Ping,"Some say it was aFatuiplot. Others say that theQixingmade it all up, and still others think that That Which Lies in the Deep is breaking free."
Madame Ping,This harbor is like a mountain of dry tinder. One spark and the fire will consume us all.
Madame Ping,"...Well, I shall say no more. This old woman's grown too old and naggy... Did you have something to say, youngster?"
Traveller: We'd like to borrow the Cleansing Bell.
Madame Ping,"Ah, that old trinket... I remember it being here with me, but I've grown old. I can't quite recall where it is exactly."
Madame Ping,"An old friend of mine used to wear it on his person, back when I was young..."
Madame Ping,He saw me gazing at it often and gave it to me.
Madame Ping,"But he told me then that if someone should come to borrow that bell, I should not be loath to part with it."
Traveller: We'd like to borrow something from you...
Madame Ping,"Borrow something? ...Oh, you've come to borrow the Cleansing Bell, yes?"
Madame Ping,"Apart from that, I don't have anything of value that you youngsters might want."
Madame Ping,"But it was not originally mine, either. That trinket used to belong to a friend of mine."
Madame Ping,"I was a vain beauty when I was young, and I would pester him for that bell all the time."
Madame Ping,"He could not dissuade me, and so he gave it to me. But he said that if someone should come to borrow it, I must not be loath to give it away."
Madame Ping,"It has been many years, and who knows how many times someone has come to borrow this bell."
Madame Ping,"Still, though I can't recall when it started, it's been a long time since anyone has come to borrow it."
Madame Ping,"Ah, these old bones are so slow to look for things. I doubt you can wait that long..."
Traveller: We can look for it ourselves.
Paimon: "That's right granny. We'll follow you back home, and search for it ourselves!"
Paimon: "And... Um, we can help with chores if you have any too!"
Traveller: I'm aKnights of Favonius-certified lost property finder!
Paimon: What a weird thing to be proud of...
Madame Ping,"Alright, children, there is no need to worry. I didn't place the bell very far away."
Paimon: "Eh? Do you live near here, granny? Whoa, but this is Yujing Terrace. It's gotta be expensive!"
Madame Ping,"Haha, an old lady like me can't afford to buy a place in this city. See this ceramic teapot? My entire household is in here."
Paimon: ...How does that work?
Traveller: It contains your house keys?
Traveller: The bell is all you own?
Paimon: "Hey, that's rude!"
Paimon: "...And even if it was like that, it must be a very expensive bell, right granny?"
Traveller: "In you go, Paimon:."
Paimon: What!? There's no way Paimon: would fit in there!
Paimon: "And why do you need Paimon: to go in, anyway? Can't you just lift the lid and look inside?"
Madame Ping,"Hohoho, youngsters. I simply mean that the bell is somewhere inside this teapot, and you are quite welcome to borrow it — if you can find it."
Paimon: "This granny's so weird, what does she mean her whole household is in here. Is she playing with us?"
Madame Ping,"Aren't you youngsters in a hurry to find that bell? Hop to it, then."
Madame Ping,But be careful. I haven't cleaned this place up in a long time.
Madame Ping,"If you were to get dirt on your beautiful clothes, it would take some work to clean up."
Paimon: Ehh? Where are we? What... just happened?
Madame Ping,"Youngsters, this is where this old woman keeps all her things. Quickly now, go fetch that bell."
Paimon: Whoa! That sounds like granny's voice. So... this is her teapot?
Paimon: What's going on...
Madame Ping,"Oh dear, so manycobwebs. It seems I really haven't cleaned it in a long while."
Madame Ping,"Sorry to trouble you, children. Please help an old lady clean up."
Paimon: Did you notice? Thecobwebswere made of elemental energy.
Paimon: How long has it been since granny last swept this place?
Paimon: "You know... with such a special teapot, and the Cleansing Bell..."
Paimon: Do you think this old granny could also be anadeptus?
Paimon: Paimon:'s more and more convinced that she's an adeptus.
Paimon: But don't they all live inJueyun Karst?
Paimon: Why would she stay in the city?
Paimon: "Um, how many levels does this teapot have?"
Paimon: It would be nice if we had one of these too.
Paimon: "Or at least, we wouldn't have to camp outside..."
Madame Ping,"Oh, you've found it? Youngsters are so quick on their feet."
Madame Ping,"Now, let me see... How did this opening work again? Oh dear..."
Madame Ping,"Alright, that'll do. Come on out now, children."
Madame Ping,"Ho-ho, in and out in no time... You youngsters really are quick."
Traveller: "Are you an adeptus, ma'am?"
Madame Ping,An adeptus... I haven't heard anyone say those words in earnest for a long time.
Madame Ping,"As to whether I am one or not, child, surely you already understand?"
Traveller: Are you one of the Liyue Qixing?
Madame Ping,The Qixing... Those children stopped letting my friends and I into their counsel long ago.
Madame Ping,"Still, they've done well recently. We old folks are content to be idle."
Traveller: Are you with the Fatui?
Madame Ping,"The Fatui? Hah! Child, what goes on in that mind of yours, I wonder?"
Madame Ping,I'm far too old to be quibbling with them.
Madame Ping,"But if they overreach themselves, I will do what I must."
Paimon: "Ugh... Paimon: kinda knows what you mean, but is also kinda confused. Are you really giving us the bell just like that Granny?"
Paimon: "Don't you think it's weird? Something's just happened to Rex Lapis, and then we come running up asking for it..."
Madame Ping,"Oh, don't be silly. Liyue Harbor has been through a great deal in its history. In that time, it has seen the departure of countless adepti."
Madame Ping,"But no matter what, we have always performed the Rite of Parting first before any other matters."
Madame Ping,"To cry ""catch the murderer!"" at the top of one's lungs, but ignore the Rite of Parting... That, to me, is what is wrong-headed."
Madame Ping,"Now that you have come to borrow the bell, I guess that perhaps an old friend of mine has finally decided to take matters into their own hands."
Madame Ping,"So, why would I be unwilling to lend you the bell?"
Traveller: What if your friend doesn't return it?
Madame Ping,"Oh? Well, if it came to that... Haha, they would find a certain old lady knocking at their door."
Madame Ping,"We haven't met in a while anyway, it would be nice to share a drink and chat."
Traveller: Can I keep it?
Paimon: Hey! It belongs to granny! We're supposed to return what we borrow!
Madame Ping,"Let you keep it? Haha, you really are a frank child. If you want it, you can keep it."
Madame Ping,"But this bell gets homesick sometimes. Who knows, it might find its way back into these old hands..."
Madame Ping,"Well, you must have things to do. Since you have the bell, you should return."
Madame Ping,"Oh, and, do tell the person who sent you..."
Madame Ping,"...that if they have time, they can come over for tea. I don't have much to offer, but you can always count on an old lady for a pot of tea."
Paimon: "We will! Thanks, granny!"
Madame Ping,It seems my old friends just can't stand idly by anymore.
Madame Ping,Let's just hope nothing messy comes of this.
Zhongli: "Indeed, this is the Cleansing Bell. Hmm, it's in good condition."
Zhongli: Let's place the perfume we've prepared inside.
Traveller: Do you know Madame Ping?
Zhongli: "Of course. How would I know that the bell was with her, otherwise?"
Traveller: Are you also an adeptus?
Zhongli: An adeptus...
Paimon: "That's suspicious! But if you don't want to talk about it, we won't pry."
Paimon: "Oh, yes! That old granny asked us to tell you something."
Paimon: """If you have the time, you can come over for tea. I don't have much to offer, but you can always count on an old lady for a pot of tea."""
Zhongli: "Ha, that tone does not suit you. Still, her tea pot is indeed very good. There are none better for brewing tea."
Zhongli: "When a suitable time arrives, I'll bring a spot of fine tea and pay her a visit."
Paimon: "So, what's the next step in our preparations?"
Zhongli: "Hmm... Next, we need to purchasekites."
Paimon: Ooh! Paimon: loves kites! Are you taking us kite flying? Is this our break time?
Zhongli: "Haha, no, no. Kites are children's toys, yes, but they also play various symbolic roles in Liyue's rituals."
Zhongli: I will explain it to you. But our next course of action should probably be to purchase the kites first.
Paimon: "Oh, sure... curiouser and curiouser..."
Granny Shan,"Ah, sir, you're here. The seven kites you asked for have been made to order. Would you like to take them now?"
Zhongli: Yes. Thank you.
Granny Shan,"It's rare to see customers who want to buy this type of kite nowadays. In the early days, we used to get orders from people of all walks of life..."
Paimon: "Well, this is Mr. Zhongli: from theWangsheng Funeral Parlor, so he's probably well-versed in all these walks of life."
Paimon: We've talked about a whole bunch of things while traveling with him...
Traveller: "Fashion, economics, jewelry and jade pottery..."
Traveller: "Tea, perfumes, flora and fauna..."
Paimon: "He seems to know Liyue's favorite topics, money and government, really well, but he likes talking about less useful topics instead."
Zhongli: "Well, that's because I prefer to share fun things with you."
Granny Shan,"Children's toys are very fun things, that's for sure. I enjoy watching the children at play as much as anyone else. But there is more to it than that."
Granny Shan,"Finely crafted toys are well-loved by children. But this craft itself has been honed over thousands of years, and there is meaning behind that."
Granny Shan,"I have made kites in Liyue for forty years, and I am intimately familiar with the forms passed down from my ancestors. The meaning of these seven kites is far from banal."
Zhongli: Indeed. These are decorations used in the Rite of Parting. The seven kites representThe Seven.
Granny Shan,I took the liberty of coloring outside the lines when doing the insignia of theAnemo Archon.
Granny Shan,"As for the kite that honors theGeo Archon, one must follow the contract given right down to the last letter. These patterns are ancient, and you can also find them in theGolden House."
Paimon: "Ah, Paimon:'s heard that name before—"
Traveller: Shh!
Traveller: "Paimon:  stop talking..."
Paimon: Huh?
Zhongli: The design of this kite displays a firm grasp on the cyclicality and eternity so dear to the Electro Archon.
Zhongli: "These markings of tree and leaf pay due honor to wisdom and the passage of time. All this, on a single kite — truly astonishing."
Zhongli: "Justice flows across the surface of the waters, war rages like a flame, as does that which theCryo Archononce... yes, these details are masterfully done."
Granny Shan,"Hehehe, the compliments of a learned man truly are pleasant."
Zhongli: "Well then, Granny Shan, I shall take these back with me. As for the payment..."
Traveller: Uh-oh!
Traveller: """As for the payment,"" he says!"
Childe:,"Well, allow me."
Paimon: "Hey, it's Childe:!"
Traveller: Did you arrange to meet here?
Childe:,"Haha. No, I was merely passing through."
Traveller: You ambushed us!
Childe:,"Haha, no way. I was just passing through!"
Childe:,"I see Mr. Zhongli:'s the same as ever. When paying— Well, when getting others to pay for him, he neither looks at the price tag nor his wallet."
Childe:,"He knows a great deal about money, and about the trials of the common man. He just doesn't consider poverty to be something that could ever happen to him."
Childe:,Or perhaps you could say that he cannot imagine himself lacking money.
Paimon: How has he not died of hunger yet?
Zhongli: "...Childe:, you are as fond of jokes as ever. Well then, since we've purchased our kites without incident, there's no need to take a break before moving to the next step in our preparations."
Zhongli: The Rite of Parting requires helping hands as well as materials. We should be able to find some people near the harbor.
Childe:,"Oh, by the way, Traveler, take this bag of money. You probably won't want to let Zhongli: do the bargaining, if you know what I mean."
Childe:,Hmm... It seems I missed out on some interesting information.
Childe:,...I suppose I'll just have to find a more opportune moment next time.
Tic,"Oh? Help? Sure! I, Tic, always put in one hundred percent effort into everything I do! Of course, there'll be a premium if you want me to give a hundred and ten percent."
Tic,So what's the job?
Zhongli: "Let me see... we are still missing some wooden implements over at Yujing Terrace. They aren't uncommon objects, so I didn't make any special preparations for them."
Traveller: "Fetch me 50 tree branches, and 20 stacks of timber!"
Tic,No problem. That'll betwenty thousand Morafor a single trip. How does that sound?
Zhongli: Done.
Traveller: "Wait, let's talk prices."
Tic,Let me think... Deal. This price is reasonable. I'll hop right to it.
Tic,"Huh? No, no... How about a bit more. This amount isn't worth going out of the way to make only one trip."
Tic,"Oh, come on, that's too little."
Tic,"You're mad! And to think I was so willing to bargain, too! Twenty thousand Mora, and not one Mora less! If not, the deal's off!"
Paimon: "Hey, don't get mad... Ah, guess we have no choice but to pay in full, (Traveler)."
Traveller: We have a deal.
Tic,"Oh? You're a straight shooter, huh? We have a deal."
Traveller: "Ugh, we brought too little money..."
Tic,This is all you've got? Then no can do.
Traveller: Please go look for someone named Childe:...
Tic,"Childe:? No, no, no. He's putting up the money? Still, no. Wouldn't that mean that I have to make two trips rather than one?"
Tic,"How about this. Let's make a trade. I'll take what you're offering right now, and..."
Tic,"Get me a singleQingxin flower, and I'll consider that payment for a detour to find this Childe: fellow. How does that sound?"
Paimon: Guess we've got no choice.
Tic,Have you brought the goods?
Tic,"Hey, that's pretty good. These things are pretty rare, and I have no idea where I'd find them."
Tic,"With this Qingxin flower, I should be able to pacify my daughter tonight. I'll make sure the work is done before I return home."
Tac,"A full day of odd jobs at Yujing Terrace? Hmm... No problem.Twenty-five thousandper day. A fair trade, yes?"
Paimon: "Whoa, that's expensive. Um, could you give us a bit of a discount on account of the whole Hero of Mondstadt thing?"
Tac,Hero of Mondstadt? Never heard of them.
Zhongli: "Well, you may never have heard of this hero, but it seems you've heard of Mora nevertheless, thus I will simply pay the whole sum."
Traveller: "Wait, let's talk prices."
Tac,This price'll do. No loss to me for a day's work.
Tac,This... is too little. I'd consider it if it was a bit higher.
Tac,That's too little. Hardly a fair price.
Tac,"That's enough! I'm done! Twenty-five thousand, and not a Mora less! Take it or leave it!"
Paimon: "Hey, don't get mad... Ah, guess we have no choice but to pay in full, (Traveler)."
Traveller: We'll pay in full.
Tac,"Hey, that's a good price. Anyone would work for this much Mora."
Traveller: "Ugh, we brought too little money..."
Tac,This is all you've got? Then no can do.
Traveller: Please go look for someone named Childe:...
Tac,"Childe:? No, no, no. He's putting up the money? Still, no. Wouldn't that mean that I have to make two trips rather than one?"
Tac,"How about this. Let's make a trade. I'll take what you're offering right now, and..."
Tac,"Find me a high-qualityLotus Head. I'll consider that my detour fee paid, and go find what's-his-face Childe:. How about it?"
Paimon: Guess we've got no choice.
Tac,Have you brought the goods?
Tac,"Oh, that looks good. I'm hitting the kitchen tonight, and it's not often that I get to use such fresh and high-end ingredients..."
Tac,"Well, I'll head to Yujing Terrace in a moment. I won't be late!"
Tac,"Oh, boss, it's you. I actually met thatChilde:guy while I was working. He's a pretty good sort."
Tac,"He gave me enough pay to stick around for several more days, all the way until we're done with that ritual of yours."
Tac,"Honestly, he's way easier with his money than you are."
Toe,"Hiring help? Sure, but let me just say first that I'm a reserve member of theAdventurers' Guild. I take adventuring commissions, but I don't do anything clerical."
Zhongli: Adventure... venturing into the mountains to capture a few crystalflies seems adventurous enough.
Traveller: "Brave adventurer, we have need of 5 crystalflies."
Toe,"Eh? That's not hard, almost a bit too easy for a reserve adventurer... Eh, never mind. I'll only charge youfifteen thousand Mora. What say you?"
Zhongli: A most fair price.
Traveller: "No, let's negotiate..."
Toe,"Five Geo Crystalflies... Yes, I do think it's worth about this much. I'll do it."
Toe,"Let's see... No. Go higher, or I'm not doing this."
Toe,"That won't do, I'm afraid. It's too little! Too little, I say!"
Toe,"Fifteen thousand Mora, not one less! That's the lowest I'm going, end of story!"
Paimon: "Hey, don't get mad... Ah, guess we have no choice but to pay in full, (Traveler)."
Traveller: "Yes, a fair price."
Toe,A pleasure doing business with you.
Traveller: "Ugh, we brought too little money..."
Toe,This is all you've got? Then no can do.
Traveller: Please go look for someone named Childe:...
Toe,"Childe:? No, no, no. He's putting up the money? Still, no. Wouldn't that mean that I have to make two trips rather than one?"
Toe,"How about this. Let's make a trade. I'll take what you're offering right now, and..."
Toe,Get me a piece ofiron ore. I'll take that as payment to go see that Childe: person. What do you think?
Paimon: Guess we've got no choice...
Toe,Have you brought the goods?
Toe,"Mm, this is good ore. As an adventurer, one must have a trusty weapon by one's side..."
Toe,"This'll work. Once I've finished, I will go and claim my payment."
Childe:,All finished then? Splendid. Any leftover cash is yours to keep — a favor for the Fatui should never go unrewarded.
Paimon: You think you can buy us off with some loose change? No way! Paimon: demands to know when the next payment is coming!
Childe:,"Haha. Well, how does this sound :  You give me the information I need, and maybe I'll leave theNorthland Bank's vaults open and unattended for half an hour…"
Paimon: What info do you need!?
Traveller: No!
Paimon: "Huh? (Traveler), does that mean you know what he's after?"
Traveller: What else could the Fatui want?
Traveller: Are you forgetting what happened in Mondstadt?
Paimon: "Yikes! You're right,Signora..."
Childe:,...
Childe:,"You both need to calm down... I don't know what's gotten into you, (Traveler)."
Childe:,Just what is this about? The atmosphere got so tense all of a sudden.
Paimon: Ehh...
Zhongli: "Next, we need some Everlasting Incense. For this, we need to go toBubu Pharmacy, the finest pharmacy in all of—"
Zhongli: Is... everything okay?
Childe:,Everything is fine. I was just informing them that they need not return the surplus Mora.
Childe:,"Now if you'll excuse me, I must be going."
Paimon: Paimon: definitely felt like Childe: wasn't happy with us just now...
Paimon: "Huh, the reception is deserted. And it seems kinda spooky in here..."
Paimon: Hello? Is anybody there?
Qiqi:,Welcome to Bubu Pharmacy.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: D-did you hear that? Wh-Where did it come from?
Zhongli: "The reception, it seems."
Paimon: "(Traveler), how about... you go check it out, and... Paimon: will bring up the rear."
Paimon: "Oh, there you are! But you can't even reach the counter!"
Traveller: Is she... a zombie!?
Paimon: Ah... Paimon: thinks you might be right! Look at the talisman on her forehead!
Traveller: "Paimon:  if we're going to talk about height, you ahh..."
Paimon: "Joke's on you — Paimon: floats, so height is no restriction."
Paimon: "Anyway, there's something weird about this one over here. What's that talisman doing on her forehead?"
Paimon: It can't be... she's... a zombie!?
Qiqi:,Welcome to Bubu Pharmacy. I am Qiqi:.
Qiqi:,"Once upon a time, Qiqi: died. Then, Qiqi: was saved by theadepti. Now, Qiqi: is a zombie."
Traveller: Such nonchalant delivery for a bombshell revelation...
Traveller: Do zombies also count as adepti...?
Paimon: Something like this would be unimaginable inMondstadt...
Zhongli: Hello... little girl. Do you sell Everlasting Incense here?
Qiqi:,"Excuse me, sir. Did you bring your prescription?"
Zhongli: I... Surely no prescription is needed to purchase Everlasting Incense? It's not a controlled substance...
Qiqi:,"Qiqi: can get your medicine. But only if you show Qiqi: your prescription. These are Qiqi:'s orders, from Qiqi:."
Traveller: "Orders"?
Traveller: Why is she being so difficult?
Zhongli: I'm afraid that she's probably right — it's to do with her orders.
Zhongli: "Zombies are limited to acting within the confines of their orders. And somehow, in this case, the zombie issues her own orders to herself."
Zhongli: "My dear Qiqi:, we didn't bring a prescription, I'm afraid. But we do hope that you can still help us find some Everlasting Incense."
Qiqi:,Okay then.
Paimon: How did you manage that?
Qiqi:,"But, Qiqi: helps you, you help Qiqi:. Only fair."
Paimon: Since when do customers need to do favors for customer service staff?
Zhongli: "Never mind, just think of it as a peer-to-peer transaction. That way everybody wins. Sometimes, in Liyue, the art of the deal is simply about victory via mental gymnastics."
Qiqi:,Go toMt. Tianheng. Find theGuizhong Ballista. And hunt a Cocogoat. Please and thank you.
Traveller: Hunt the what with the which at where?
Zhongli: Guizhong Ballista... I have heard of this device before.
Traveller: She's playing games with us...
Zhongli: "I don't believe so. The Guizhong Ballista, at least, I have heard of before."
Zhongli: "It is a kind of crossbow turret, installed on Mt. Tianheng by an adeptus[Note 1]in the distant past. An early mechanical device."
Zhongli: "Located in Tianheng Pass, it was designed to automatically fire at large monsters, protecting Liyue from external threats."
Paimon: Mr. Zhongli: really knows Liyue inside out!
Zhongli: "Apparently, not quite... This is the first I have ever heard of the ""Cocogoat."""
Qiqi:,The Cocogoat is a legendary animal. An adeptibeast.
Paimon: "Did you wanna add anything else, or..."
Qiqi:,No. Just that the Cocogoat is a legendary animal. An adeptibeast.
Qiqi:,"What it looks like, don't know. Where to find it, don't know either. Where it came from,  also don't know."
Traveller: Do tell us if you remember anything else you don't remember...
Traveller: This isn't much to go on...
Zhongli: Very well then... Let's start by investigating near theGuizhong Ballista. Perhaps we will find some clues.
Paimon: What the heck is a Cocogoat...
Qiqi:,Cocogoat. Go find it.
Paimon: It's huge! Paimon: can totally believe it took an adeptus to build this.
Paimon: But... how do you operate this thing? Just think how much strength you would need...
Zhongli: "Hmm... It is currently inoperable, in any case. This device is broken."
Paimon: "Aw, what? It broke!?"
Zhongli: "After millennia of wear and tear, even adepti contraptions are difficult to maintain."
Paimon: "So what're we gonna do? Quick, Mr. Zhongli:  use your unlimited high-society knowledge powers!"
Zhongli: "Hmm. You almost make it sound like I'm some sort of... bourgeois parasite, whose only utility lies in providing quaint pieces of trivia on demand."
Zhongli: "That said, let me think for a moment... Ah yes. Spare parts were made for the Guizhong Ballista when it was first built, in case it was damaged in battle."
Zhongli: "As I recall, there is a military supply post from that period somewhere inside the Pass."
Zhongli: "If we can retrieve the spare parts from where they are stored, we may be able to repair the Guizhong Ballista. One just needs to understand the basic working principles of the device."
Paimon: So... what you're saying is that you actually understand the working principles?
Zhongli: I have a smattering of knowledge on the topic.
Zhongli: "With thepartsin hand, I could at least tinker with it."
Paimon: "Where is that supply post? Here, posty posty posty..."
Zhongli: These parts look useful.
Zhongli: "One moment, I will try to repair the device..."
Zhongli: It is done. The Guizhong Ballista is more intricately designed than I thought.
Paimon: Woo! Now how do we turn it on?
Zhongli: "It's easy enough. We simply need to do this... Look, it even has a scope."
Paimon: Over here we have... nothing. And over there... More nothing.
Freckle Huang,Hey! Just what do you think you're doing!?
Freckle Huang,"So you fixed up this turret... because you're planning to do what, exactly!?"
Zhongli: "Not a turret. A Guizhong Ballista. Also, kindly state your name before you ask a question, it's just good manners."
Freckle Huang,"Ha! Are you blind or something? You're looking at the leader of the Treasure Hoarders, old man!"
Freckle Huang,"This area's supposed to be chock-full of hidden treasures, but you can't get anywhere near them with this thing keeping watch. It might look like any other mechanical device, but trust me, it's got a mind of its own!"
Freckle Huang,"Last time we approached the mountain, it nearly skewered one of our guys!"
Freckle Huang,"A few of us risked our lives to disarm it — which, amazingly, we managed — and then we turn our backs for two seconds and you've ALREADY GONE AND REPAIRED IT!?"
Freckle Huang,"The next thing you'll be repairing is your faces, and that's if you get out of this alive!"
Zhongli: Tut-tut. Vandalizing the legacy of an adeptus for selfish gain. Disgraceful behavior.
Zhongli: "It is not we who need reprimanding, but you."
Paimon: These lowlifes didn't know who they were messing with!
Zhongli: Troubling ourselves over this rabble is not worth the time. We should focus on our contract with Qiqi:.
Paimon: "Oh yeah... that. So we've got the Guizhong Ballista working, but where's our Cocogoat?"
Zhongli: "A search using the Guizhong Ballista revealed no significant life forms nearby, save for the usual wildlife."
Zhongli: "What's more, a contraption built using adeptus technology should have no trouble detecting an ""adeptibeast"" as Qiqi: put it."
Paimon: Sigh... Which means...
Traveller: ...
Traveller: Repairing this was a complete waste of time?
Paimon: "Paimon: wouldn't go that far. We did something positive, right?"
Zhongli: "We won't solve anything while standing here and racking our brains. Let's return to Bubu Pharmacy, explain that we could not find a Cocogoat, and review our next step."
Paimon: "Good idea. We did our best, and that's what counts."
Zhongli: "Forgive us, we were unable to fulfill our end of the contract. We found no trace of the Cocogoat adeptibeast of which you speak."
Qiqi:,Ah. What a disappointment. Don't worry about it. But I feel very disappointed.
Paimon: "Aw, poor Qiqi:... Why does Paimon: feel so guilty all of a sudden?"
Traveller: "Qiqi:, do you have any other clues?"
Traveller: What do you need this Cocogoat for?
Qiqi:,Cocogoat milk is tasty. So tasty. Much better than normal goat milk. Only an adeptibeast could make such tasty milk.
Qiqi:,I'm sorry. I have a... poor memory. I cannot remember the name of the milk. That's why I wrote it down. Where did I put it...
Qiqi:,Ah. Here. This is the name. "Coconut milk."
Crowd,Ehh!?
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: "I... owe you both an apology. I hastily agreed to what appeared to be an equitable agreement with this zombie child, when perhaps I should have undertaken further due diligence."
Paimon: "Never mind Zhongli:  you didn't know. As the Liyue proverb goes, ""All things are random, and... so how are you supposed to predict anything?"" Literally no-one could have seen this coming..."
Qiqi:,"Excuse me, everyone. Did Qiqi: say a bad thing?"
Paimon: "Ooh... Sorry, (Traveler), but Paimon:'s gonna leave the job of shattering this poor kiddo's world to you..."
Traveller: It all begins with the fruit of the coconut tree...
Traveller: It's time to tell you where coconut milk comes from...
Qiqi:,No... Im-Impossible...
Paimon: Seems Qiqi: took this pretty hard.
Traveller: She just needs time to work through it.
Traveller: They all need to grow up sometime.
Baizhu:,"Haha, someone learnt a valuable life lesson today, then? Thank you all for looking after my little Qiqi:."
Zhongli: "Might I ask, who..."
Baizhu:,"Ah, how rude of me. I'm Baizhu:, boss of the Bubu Pharmacy."
Paimon: Paimon: thought Qiqi: was the boss... turns out it's some wacko who wears medicinal ingredients around his neck!
White Snake,What a sorry state of affairs... This little mascot is even more of a simpleton than Qiqi:...
Paimon: Ah! The medicine— the snake is s-speaking!
Traveller: "Wow, a talking snake!"
Traveller: Nothing in Liyue surprises me anymore.
White Snake,"Hmph! I prefer to stay silent. But faced with strangers, I must speak, lest you mistake me for an escapee from the medicine cabinet, for I am a living, breathing serpent!"
Baizhu:,"Hahaha, don't mind Changsheng, she's a good girl, really. As for you three... Communal chaos-causing with Qiqi: aside, what business brings you here?"
Zhongli: Do you sell Everlasting Incense in this fine establishment?
Baizhu:,"Everlasting Incense? Why, of course we do!"
Paimon: "Phew, at last! Things are finally starting to come together—"
Baizhu:,"Three million Mora, top quality, guaranteed."
Traveller: Three million?!
Paimon: "You might as well just rob the Golden House! Oh, but the Qixing have taken it over for now... Security will be tighter than usual."
Traveller: You might as well just rob the Golden House!
Paimon: Too bad the Qixing have taken it over for now... Security will be tighter than usual.
Zhongli: "Hmm... Three million... An innocuous number in and of itself, though practically speaking, it could be a hard sum to come by."
Paimon: "It's a crazy number! We'd never be able to make that much Mora, and as for Mr. Zhongli:... he's around three million short."
Zhongli: This is correct.
Traveller: No shame...
Paimon: What are we gonna do? Is this the part where we go crawling back to Childe:?
Childe:,Bwahahahahahahahaha!
Childe:,"Cocogoat! Cocogo— Ahahaow my sides hurt... Oh my goodness, I cannot BELIEVE you fell for that!"
Paimon: "Hey! Less laughter, more sympathy!"
Childe:,"I'm almost in tears over here... Ah, thank you, that was the best laugh I've had in a long time. In return, I'm more than happy to sort out this mess you've managed to get yourselves into..."
Childe:,"Excuse me, sir... Dr. Baizhu:, isn't it? Truly honored. I'm Childe:, one of the Fatui harbingers. Forgive my audacity, but I see a great many opportunities for us to collaborate in the future..."
Childe:,"If Bubu Pharmacy needed a stable supply of, say, coconut milk, the Fatui could help by setting up a robust and speedy distribution network."
Changsheng,"Strange... I knew the Fatui infiltrated businesses with seductive deals, but... So much fuss over coconut milk?"
Qiqi:,Coconut milk. Baizhu:. Quick. Qiqi: wants coconut milk.
Baizhu:,"Ah... Yes, of course, Qiqi:, anything you want... Th-Thank you, Childe:. I look forward to a successful collaboration in the future. I can give you a discount on that Everlasting Incense too, let's say... 2,990,000 Mora."
Paimon: "That's like, zero difference from three million!"
Zhongli: "Hmm... 2,990,000... Also an innocuous number in and of itself, though practically speaking it is a whole ten thousand less than the original sum of three million."
Zhongli: "Well, now that this is settled, we must head back to Yujing Terrace. Mr. Childe:, Dr. Baizhu:, Little Miss Qiqi:, see you soon."
Childe:,"That lot is an absolute riot. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard."
Childe:,"So. You've been eavesdropping, I hope. What have I missed?"
Ekaterina,"Yes, Master Childe:. They spoke of the Qixing taking the Golden House..."
Childe:,"Well, well, well. Ningguang: and her Qixing cronies. What else would they be hiding in the Golden House... if not the Exuvia?"
Childe:,"I apologize, (Traveler). But I warned you, didn't I? As the old Liyue saying goes :  ""The walls have ears."""
Qiqi:,"This is good. There will be coconut milk from now on. Yes, it's good."
Baizhu:,"What an odd exchange we've had. Well, I look forward to your patronage in the future as well. Hahaha."
Changsheng,That sound is the laughter of a man who's found new people to fleece. Consider yourselves warned...
Zhongli: "Well, as it stands, we've hired helpers, and we've acquired the Everlasting Incense. The completion of our preparations is not far off."
Paimon: Whew... Finally!
Zhongli: "Well, Traveler. Have you gained anything from our adventure so far?"
Traveller: It's been... odd.
Zhongli: Odd?
Traveller: I'm not sure if we've been living the high life...
Traveller: Or experiencing the struggles of the poor?
Zhongli: "Haha, which is it, I wonder?"
Zhongli: "The questions that such travels raise are ever so complicated. Well, I'll leave you to ruminate over it yourself. As to remuneration for your help, I've decided..."
Zhongli: ...to treat you to a meal.
Traveller: Zhongli:... treating?
Traveller: Wow. Amazing.
Zhongli: "Oh? Ah, yes, don't worry. I will remember to bring the Mora this time."
Zhongli: "Tonight, I shall take you both to an old hole-in-the-wall, praised throughout Liyue."
Paimon: Hole-in-the-wall? As in... a cool restaurant?
Zhongli: Indeed. let us meet near the harbor at "Third-Round Knockout."
Zhongli: "Ah, you're here. There's no need to order, I've already done so."
Zhongli: """Third-Round Knockout"" is not for lightweights, like those taverns in Mondstadt. Here, the owner does not take such unorthodox orders as fruit juice."
Traveller: "So, does this mean I can order wine this time?"
Zhongli: "I ordered some wine-fermented sweet rice balls for you, if that counts."
Traveller: I guess I should have expected this...
Iron Tongue Tian,"...If it's to your liking, dear customers, I shall continue the tale of Lady Ningguang:'s Jade Chamber."
Paimon: "Hey, there's even a storyteller here! Great atmosphere!"
Zhongli: "Besides the fine wine, the excellent ambiance is the reason why this place is so well loved."
Zhongli: "But, when I say ambiance, I refer to a different sort from the one theTeyvat Travel Guideuses to judge other establishments."
Iron Tongue Tian,"As you all know, high above the land of Liyue lies a pavilion in the clouds, a palace in the mist..."
Iron Tongue Tian,"What does it mean to have all-seeing eyes? This, my friends.  Lady Ningguang:'s masterwork that bridges earth and sky."
Iron Tongue Tian,"Imagine. The weather is clear, and you gaze down from the deck on the world below..."
Iron Tongue Tian,"Behold! The glorious sights of Liyue Harbor, stretching out far and wide!"
Iron Tongue Tian,"They say that when Lady Ningguang: ponders important affairs, she retreats to her Jade Chamber with none but her three closest confidantes in tow. Why brings she these trusted three? To sift through sources, dig through documents — looking for information."
Iron Tongue Tian,"Piece by piece, facts and figures paint a picture on the walls of the chamber... But well before the wall is filled, Lady Ningguang:'s mind is made up."
Iron Tongue Tian,"Having made her call, she has every last document shredded. And fwoosh! she scatters the shavings out her window."
Iron Tongue Tian,"Ah, look at them! How they billow in the wind like a sudden swirling blizzard! As the fragments fall, traces of text flicker before the eyes of the merchants of Liyue like ink stains in white snow."
Iron Tongue Tian,"The saying goes, the rarest treasures in the land are the words brought by the paper snow. For the words of the Tianquan have the power to move mountains and all throughout the land know it."
Iron Tongue Tian,"These are but scraps of paper, and yet they guide Lady Ningguang:'s hand — such is their value."
Iron Tongue Tian,Merely grasping one or two of them will surely gift you a fragment of her wisdom — enough to stay a step or two ahead of your peers.
Paimon: Tianquan Ningguang:... feels like we're hearing this name a lot.
Paimon: "Liyue locals talk about her, theFatuihate her, she's most likely the one who hid the Exuvia, and we saw her at the Rite of Descension..."
Paimon: Paimon: wonders what sort of person she is.
Ganyu: "At last, I have found you, you who returned from Jueyun Karst."
Paimon: Who's there?
Traveller: "(Paimon:  we gotta go...!)"
Ganyu: "Wait, I am not with the Millelith, nor am I here to claim your bounty!"
Ganyu: "However, I am an emissary of the Liyue Qixing. My name is Ganyu:  secretary at the Yuehai Pavilion, and I have come specifically to meet you."
Traveller: Emissary?
Traveller: Secretary?
Ganyu: "Well, in concrete terms, I am the corporate secretary for the Qixing. At the moment, I am serving as Lady Ningguang:'s special emissary."
Paimon: Ningguang: sent you? We were literally just talking about her...
Ganyu: "My apologies, you who have returned from Jueyun Karst... I am duty-bound, and cannot extend my courtesy to you in full."
Ganyu: But I have with me a letter from lady Ningguang:. She extends a formal invitation to you in her capacity as Tianquan.
Ganyu: She invites you to her palace in the sky.
Paimon: An official invitation...?
Ganyu: Lady Ningguang: said this
Ganyu: "Invite (him/her) to come here."
Ganyu: "I wish to meet (him/her)."
Ganyu: """At the Jade Chamber, together, we shall snip every one of these entwining dark threads."""
Paimon: "And with that, the emissary who called herself Ganyu: just disappeared."
Paimon: But we've received an invitation from the Liyue Qixing. Paimon: still can't believe it!
Paimon: (Traveler)! We'll be meeting people that have any more money than Paimon: could ever count! We should be on our very best manners!
Traveller: I always mind my manners.
Traveller: Paimon: is up to something again...
Zhongli: "Hah... An invitation to visit the Jade Chamber is a rare honor, indeed."
Zhongli: "You'd best be on your way now. But don't forget about the Rite of Parting. Once you've finished at the Jade Chamber, meet me at Dihua Marsh."
Paimon: "Don't worry, we won't forget! Dihua Marsh. We'll see you there!"
Zhongli: Ningguang:... Ganyu:...
Zhongli: I wonder where we will find them amid these dark tides?
Paimon: "Look, up there! That's the Jade Chamber."
Traveller: That's pretty high up.
Traveller: "Question is, how do we get up there?"
Paimon: Hmm... Uhh...
Paimon: "Ah, this is bad, Paimon:'s supposed to be your guide, but Paimon: doesn't know where the way up to the Jade Chamber is..."
Traveller: You're only realizing that now!?
Traveller: "We should have asked that emissary, Ganyu:."
Paimon: Ugh...
Paimon: "Well, since we want to go to the Jade Chamber, heading to its location on the map is the sensible thing to do!"
Paimon: Let's look around. There has to be a way up there nearby!
Paimon: "Hey, look! There's some sort of mechanism thingy!"
Paimon: "Since this is the right place, it must have something to do with the Jade Chamber."
Traveller: Maybe it's the way to the Jade Chamber?
Paimon: "Yes, this must be the way!"
Traveller: It looks like some sort of trap.
Paimon: No way! Just trust Paimon:'s instincts!
Paimon: Huh? It only takes us up to here...
Paimon: "Aw, if that wind current was strong, we'd be able to reach the top in one go!"
Traveller: Best we go back to Liyue and ask the Millelith...
Paimon: Huh? Why?
Traveller: "The way up shouldn't be a secret, or..."
Paimon: "Or? ...Oh, Paimon: gets it! If it was a secret, Ganyu: wouldn't have let us try to find it ourselves, right?"
Paimon: "Alright, let's follow your plan, then we can..."
Paimon: Ooh! Hang on a moment. Look down there!
Paimon: Looks like we've gotten close to theGuizhong Ballista.
Paimon: Hmm... Uh... Paimon: has a new idea!
Paimon: Why don't we shoot you up to the Jade Chamber using the Ballista?
Traveller: No thanks. I don't have a death wish.
Paimon: Oh... Right. This method does seem a bit unsafe...
Traveller: "Still, I do remember that the Ballista had a scope."
Traveller: Do you really hate me that much?
Paimon: Uh... No. Paimon: may have just forgotten to think about safety measures...
Traveller: "Still, I do remember that the Ballista had a scope."
Paimon: "Oh, that's right!"
Paimon: "Now that you mention it, we could use the Guizhong Ballista to see if there's another way up nearby!"
Huaqing,Halt!
Huaqing,Who trespasses on these hallowed grounds?
Traveller: We're just passing through...
Traveller: Hallowed what now? These are the wilds around Mt. Tianheng...
Paimon: Exactly. What're you talking about?
Paimon: We're invited guests! What makes you think you can treat us like this?
Paimon: No... Wait... Maybe this was Ningguang:'s plan all along!
Paimon: "She pretended to invite us to the Jade Chamber, but set up a Millelith ambush here to arrest us!"
Traveller: I'm quite sure that's not the case.
Traveller: We haven't explained the invitation to them yet...
Paimon: "Grr... Now Paimon:'s mad! ...You! Over there! This is a trick, isn't it? How shameless!"
Huaqing,"What? We're just on guard duty. What do you mean, ""shameless""?"
Yang,What nonsense! Seize these suspicious intruders at once!
Paimon: "Well, here they come — line 'em up and knock 'em down!"
Keqing: Stop! What's all this about?
Huaqing,"Lady Keqing:  these two strange people suddenly appeared. They seem to have designs on the Guizhong Ballista."
Paimon: Who're you calling "strange"?
Traveller: We were just looking for the way to the Jade Chamber.
Keqing: Hmm? You want to go to the Jade Chamber? Who are you?
Paimon: "We're invited guests, here to look for the Liyue Qixing! Who are you?"
Keqing: ...
Keqing: "Well, as it happens, I am one of the Liyue Qixing."
Paimon: ???
Keqing: "I'm Keqing:  the Yuheng of the Qixing."
Keqing: "I know of you, Traveler. You're Ningguang:'s guests, yes? Didn't expect to meet you here in the mountains."
Paimon: Wow... Paimon: didn't think we'd meet some super rich big shot out here in the middle of nowhere either.
Keqing: "The Guizhong Ballista in Tianheng Pass has long been in disrepair, and yet it was fixed in a single night. I came here to investigate that occurence."
Keqing: "These Millelith are just here to guard the scene, not to arrest anyone."
Paimon: "So, this was all a misunderstanding? Paimon: never would've thought..."
Traveller: "Thinking isn't that hard, Paimon:."
Keqing: "Anyway, for a mortal to be able to repair an adepti mechanism is quite the mystery, even to the Qixing."
Paimon: "Hehe, that was..."
Traveller: "(Shh, Paimon:  don't complicate the matter!)"
Traveller: (We only did a tiny part of the work there...)
Paimon: "Eh? Oh, right. So, Lady Yuheng, might you have any idea why Lady Tianquan invited us to go to the Jade Chamber?"
Keqing: Just call me Keqing:.
Keqing: "I'd say that Ningguang:'s purpose is to request that the savior of Mondstadt take a more neutral stance... Or at least, to not wholly side with the adepti."
Paimon: We're not taking sides. We spoke with the adepti. They want to protect Liyue as well...
Keqing: "When you say ""protect,"" you're referring to their sanctimonious arrogance, aren't you?"
Paimon: Huh?
Keqing: "You are mortals, and thus under their protection. There was no way they would have regarded you as someone with the ability to assassinate a god."
Keqing: "Naturally, they would also regard Ningguang:'s locking down the area, questioning the citizenry, and pursuit of the assassin to be pointless work. Perhaps they even wonder if there might be a cover-up."
Keqing: I'll say it like it is :  they're underestimating us.
Paimon: "Well, you've got a point there..."
Paimon: "Still, this is the first time Paimon:'s seen a person from Liyue who doesn't respect the gods or the adepti."
Keqing: Hah. Should I respect the shallow sense of time and condescension to mortals that has caused them to delay in moving against us Qixing?
Keqing: "Forget it. I shouldn't speak of them this way. This skepticism is mine alone, and Ningguang: does not share it."
Keqing: "Either way, I will admit that the actions of the adepti this time were quite restrained."
Keqing: Rex Lapis' death is indeed an extraordinary circumstance. But to think that they would call for a council of adepti rather than come down here directly...
Keqing: How surprisingly civilized of them.
Traveller: Any chance you could talk it out with them?
Traveller: "Ningguang: would prefer to negotiate, wouldn't she?"
Keqing: "Well, for Ningguang:... She would talk anything and everything out if she could. But I doubt we can do that here."
Keqing: "The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue?"
Paimon: Phew... Another super bold statement...
Keqing: "*sigh* I'll stop here. Honestly, I hadn't intended to say so much. But you're a good listener, Traveler."
Keqing: "You should both be off to the Jade Chamber. Don't be late, now. Ningguang:'s schedule is packed to the gills all the way till next year."
Keqing: "The cream of Liyue's mercantile crop all see ""ascending to the Jade Chamber"" as the greatest honor. Each brings rich gifts as they visit, all to curry a little favor with Ningguang:."
Paimon: Favor?
Traveller: "Paimon:  that's not the point."
Traveller: "Paimon:  get serious."
Paimon: But... But!
Paimon: "Wait, that's right! Greeting gifts are a staple of Liyue's culture. We need to get one, not to curry favor or anything — just to... respect Liyue's culture!"
Traveller: "Ah, so eager..."
Keqing: "Alright, alright. You can decide on your greeting gift yourselves. Let me tell you how to get to the Jade Chamber first."
Keqing: "You didn't actually have to come to Mt. Tianheng. Go back to Liyue Harbor, find a guide at the Yuehai Pavilion, and..."
Keqing: "Well then. May we meet again, Traveler."
Paimon: "Well, that Yuheng may not respect the gods, but Paimon: thinks she's a pretty cool person."
Traveller: "She made a good impression on me, too."
Traveller: I agree with some of her views.
Paimon: So... What should be give to Ningguang: when we see her?
Traveller: "You really have shifted focus, haven't you, Paimon:..."
Paimon: "Oh, right! Paimon: dreamed of an amazing snack last night —Sugar-Frosted Slime!"
Paimon: Paimon: has a feeling that it would be perfect for a super rich person like Ningguang:!
Paimon: Why don't we go with that for a gift?
Traveller: "So, do you have a recipe?"
Paimon: Nope! But Paimon:'s sure that we just need to make it with some boom shaka-laka!
Traveller: And... how would we make this thing you dreamed up?
Paimon: "With a certain boom shaka-laka, of course!"
Paimon: "Let's go gather ingredients. Time waits for no-one, and neither will our riches!"
Paimon: Ooh! Look at thatslime! It looks crystal clear... and very delicious!
Paimon: That's the one!
Paimon: "Huh? Is it just Paimon:  or is there a sweet fragrance in the air...?"
Paimon: Huh... Did you hear that?
Traveller: It sounded like someone calling out for help.
Paimon: It seemed like it came from those ruins over there...
Traveller: It sounded like someone was singing.
Paimon: "Uh, no! That was definitely someone in trouble! It came from those ruins over there."
Paimon: "Uh oh, it looks like theTreasure Hoardershave locked someone inside."
Meng Dan,Help! Help me!
Meng Dan,"Phew... Thank you for you help, kind travelers. If you hadn't come to my aid, I surely would have rotted in this cell! Those Treasure Hoarders... when their mood was good, they're rearrange those pots ofSweet Flowers. But when they were in a bad mood, they're rearrange my face..."
Paimon: "Aw, it was nothing. No need to thank us all at once or anything!"
Meng Dan,"Haha, I understand. Don't worry, I will compensate you both."
Traveller: There's really no need.
Meng Dan,Don't say that! I only escaped this predicament because of you.
Meng Dan,"I'm Meng Dan, a supplier for Mingxing Jewelry inLiyue Harbor. I often walk around these mountains in search of antiques."
Meng Dan,"I never expected that those Treasure Hoarders would have their eyes on the same ruins that I had. Before I knew it, they'd caught and imprisoned me."
Meng Dan,"Is there anything that you lack? Antiques, treasures, various knick-knacks, you name it! Well, as long as you want what I have to offer, of course."
Traveller: Your goodwill is good enough for me.
Paimon: "Wait a moment! Actually, we are looking for something!"
Meng Dan,Oh? And what might that be?
Paimon: Do you have a box that can store presents? We'd like a pretty one... the kind that you can use to store snacks.
Meng Dan,"Of course we do — how can one sell antiques without gift boxes? AtMingxing Jewelry, we have the best gift-wrapping service in the seven nations."
Meng Dan,"Now, just give me a moment, and I'll let the boss know. You can go see her whenever you require that box."
Paimon: Great! Paimon:'s Sugar-Frosted Slime now comes in a beautiful package!
Paimon: Hey there! A guy called Meng Dan told us that we could get a nice and shiny box from your store...
Xingxi,Uncle Meng already told me about it. Thank you both for saving him.
Xingxi,"Many of the best goods in our store were found by Uncle Meng. If anything were to happen to him, it would be impossible for us to continue doing business."
Xingxi,"Here, this container is itself an antique, with at least 140 years of history. It's already been cleaned... Will it do?"
Paimon: Yup-yup-yup! It's great!
Paimon: Hang on a moment. Could we borrow one other thing?
Xingxi,"Sure, please help yourselves — as long as it's on our shelves."
Paimon: "(Traveler), this clay pot looks really awesome!"
Paimon: "If we use an antique as our mixing bowl, we should be able to make a great snack!"
Paimon: "It's done! The one and only Sugar-Frosted Slime! Carefully now. Into the box it goes, and dust it over with a bit more powdered sugar..."
Xingxi,Oh yes. You might want to use these two freshly-picked flowers as decorations too.
Paimon: Woohoo! It looks beautiful!
Traveller: (I'm still not sold on this gift idea...)
Paimon: "Great! Now that we've put all that we've got into this box, let's go to the Jade Chamber to see Ningguang:!"
Xingxi,Thanks for saving Uncle Meng. Please take care.
Xingxi,"Well, now... time to clean that pot..."
Paimon: "(According to Keqing:  this is what we should say...)"
Paimon: "Excuse me, do you sell the moon here?"
Bu'yun,Yes. How many would you like?
Paimon: It is not convenient to speak of numbers here.
Bu'yun,"Ah, well said. Please use this to ascend to the Chamber... Ah, yes. Speaking of which — are you two the guests that Lady Ningguang: has arranged to meet with today?"
Paimon: Yup!
Bu'yun,"(And yet the code they used was not the one for the guests, but for the Yuheng. What's going on here...)"
Bu'yun,Hello. Is there anything I can...
Bu'yun,Huh?
Ningguang: "I've been waiting for you, returnee from Jueyun Karst."
Paimon: "Ah, it's Ningguang:!"
Paimon: "Since this is our first meeting, um, we've prepared a gift! Hope you like it?"
Ningguang: "Oh, for me? You have my thanks. It seems that I have made things difficult for you, considering that you were supposed to be my guests."
Paimon: "Hehe... Oh no, it's nothing."
Traveller: "Nice place, this Jade Chamber."
Ningguang: Haha. I'm glad you like it too.
Traveller: It's my first time coming to a place this high up...
Ningguang: "This palace floats in the skies, higher than the peak of any mountain. From this vantage point, one may survey all of Liyue."
Ningguang: "I have been gathering the funds necessary to build it from the time I began learning the merchant's craft. And since becoming the Tianquan, I have spared no effort in hiring the best craftsmen to constantly extend it..."
Ningguang: "At first, it was but the size of one room. Now, it is large enough to blot out the moon in the skies above Liyue."
Ningguang: "One day, I believe it will overshadow all seven nations."
Traveller: (This Tianquan does not lack for ambition...)
Ningguang: "Not many from outside of Liyue earn the right to ascent to the Jade Chamber. But I have been in correspondence with theActing Grand Masterof theKnights of Favonius, who spoke highly of you."
Ningguang: "As such, I have been putting eyes and ears out ever since you reached Liyue..."
Paimon: What!?
Ningguang: And I finally got wind of your movements when you were on the way toWangshu Inn.
Paimon: ...Wait. WasVerr Goldetone of your people!?
Ningguang: Just Verr Goldet? ...No.
Ningguang: Everyone at Wangshu Inn is one of ours.
Paimon: @&%*!
Traveller: We also ran into the Yuheng not long ago...
Ningguang: "At the Guizhong Ballista, yes?"
Paimon: Uh... you weren't peeking on us from the skies the whole time... were you!?
Ningguang: Haha... I fear that peeking would have been a little difficult from this altitude.
Ningguang: "Our eyes and ears are more than sufficient. You two are very interesting people, after all. It would be natural to take an interest.."
Traveller: Keqing: said that the Qixing would not wish ill onRex Lapis.
Ningguang: "Well, I wouldn't expect you to trust us, considering that you have had far more interactions with theadepti. The reason I invited you here was to clear up some misunderstandings."
Ningguang: I believe that you've heard of theArchon War?
Traveller: Umm... Rings a bell.
Traveller: Only in the broadest of strokes.
Ningguang: "Many gods used to talk this earth, and many long wars were fought between them that did not abate until 2,000 years ago. Much blood was shed, and many lives were lost."
Ningguang: "In the end, only seven victors remained standing inTeyvat. They build cities and nations on the corpses of the vanquished, and thus began the era ofThe Seven."
Ningguang: "You can see Guyun Stone Forest from here, I trust? It is not natural rock formation — those are giant spears of rock, hurled by Rex Lapis during the war."
Ningguang: Beneath the spears lie those cast down by Rex Lapis in those days : gods that failed to seize the title of Archon.
Ningguang: "Not only is it true that gods may die, but so too has the membership of the Seven changed over the last two millennia. Rex Lapis' passing is an unimaginable disaster for Liyue, but the order of The Seven will not collapse simply because of that."
Ningguang: "Another Lord of Geo will arise sooner or later, yet how are we to forget Rex Lapis? When that time comes, the relationship between the people of Liyue and the gods and adepti will surely be different from before."
Ningguang: "Even in the new era, theLiyue Qixingremain Rex Lapis' former subjects... Do you really think us capable of having played a part in his demise? Of lacking the foresight to see the certain repercussions?"
Traveller: "Why hide the Exuvia, then?"
Ningguang: Heh...
Ningguang: "That day at Yujing Terrace — it was all so very sudden. Even I was caught completely off guard. You were there, you no doubt saw."
Ningguang: "But our enemy has long lain hidden within the harbor. If we do not act against them now, they will surely gain the upper hand."
Ningguang: "Hiding the Exuvia was a necessary maneuver to take the initiative back, to play the spider while our foes scurry about."
Paimon: Who's this "enemy" you're talking about?
Ningguang: "What do you think, Traveler?"
Traveller: Is it "him"?
Traveller: "It's ""him,"" isn't it?"
Paimon: Eh? What are you two talking about?
Ningguang: Well answered.
Paimon: ...Huh!?
Ningguang: "Hah... The scenery out here is fine indeed, but the wind is a little strong. Our preparations to receive guests within are complete — so please, this way."
Paimon: Wowee! What a huge hall! Paimon:'s never seen such a fancy place before...
Ningguang: "Be at ease, you two. Make yourselves at home if you wish."
Paimon: Can we really!?
Ningguang: "I have invited you two here as friends. And when friends come over to play, our enjoyment comes first, naturally."
Traveller: Is that what I think it is...?
Paimon: Ooh! Isn't this that legendary wall?
Ningguang: "Why, you've kept your ear to the ground, I see."
Paimon: That's because even the storytellers are talking about it... Everyone's after a piece of paper from that wall. It's super famous!
Ningguang: That's because that wall records Liyue's secrets. Merchants have always been attracted to secrets.
Ningguang: "But the secrets of the mercantile world are of no interest to you, are they, Traveler? You're rather special, really — and I think you're quite aware of that."
Ningguang: "If possible, I'd like to have your trust."
Ningguang: But if you were to choose the more trustworthy person between myself and Keqing:...
Traveller: "Well, between your orthodoxy and her heterodoxy..."
Traveller: I'd go with Keqing: and her skepticism of the divine.
Ningguang: Haha... You'd pick Keqing:? I had a feeling.
Ningguang: "I originally thought her a bit too... hard-headed. With someone of her character on the Qixing, I've had some extra messes to clean up behind the scenes."
Ningguang: "But after she said those words :  ""The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue..."""
Ningguang: "Well, I must say that quite a few of my doubts have been dispelled."
Ningguang: "I won't deny that Rex Lapis' passing seems advantageous to us. But for Liyue's sake, we cannot allow ourselves to be shackled by rumors of our usurpation of power."
Traveller: I surmise that theFatuihas a hand in these rumors?
Ningguang: Indeed... It seems that you understood what I meant to say from the very beginning.
Ningguang: "I called for the gag order and for the Exuvia to be hidden to temporarily stabilize the situation, and also to prevent something similar to the incident in Mondstadt."
Ningguang: "With Rex Lapis' death, the Fatui have busied themselves with many clandestine actions beyond their diplomatic remit. As the Tianquan, one responsible for Liyue, I cannot be too concerned with appearances when opposing them."
Ningguang: Allowing the Rite of Parting to take place was also meant to buy some time for us to take control of Liyue's administration...
Paimon: Ugh... It's exactly as Zhongli: said. The Qixing only provided the venue for the rite so they could use us for their own ends.
Paimon: "Wait, that's right! Speaking of ends... Could Paimon: say one other thing?"
Ningguang: Of course.
Paimon: "Paimon:'s heard that anyone who sends a greeting gift gets a little something in return... So, does that include us?"
Traveller: "Seriously, Paimon:? Seriously?"
Ningguang: "Hmm-hmm, It's quite alright. I like direct people."
Ningguang: "Well, we have made quite a bit of trouble for you recently. How about this? You can pick any one object here as you please, and you may take it with you."
Paimon: "Yay! Paimon: was just waiting for you to say that! Let's see, what should we get..."
Paimon: One of thosesheetson that wall!
Traveller: ???
Paimon: "Don't look at Paimon: like that! One of these sheets of paper will sell for crazy prices, even if it's only as large as Paimon:'s fingernail!"
Paimon: "Just imagine... how much Mora a whole, untorn sheet would sell for!"
Paimon: Let's grab one! The biggest one!
Paimon: Huh? Well that was an easy search. The biggest sheet is right up there in the most obvious spot. Let's go with that one!
Paimon: La la-la la-la... Let's see what's written on it.
Paimon: "Huh? There's a place marked with a circle on here. Ooh, could it be treasure!? Whatever it is, it better make us filthy rich! Let's see what's written over here..."
Paimon: "Sigil"..."of Permission"... Mm-hmm and... "Fatui"... "research"..."copy"... Huh?
Paimon: "Aw, that doesn't sound like treasure at all."
Paimon: This piece of paper shows that a Qixing spy discovered traces of classified Fatui research on theSigil of Permission.
Paimon: "Oh, Ningguang: did say that the Fatui have been up to all kinds of mischief in the shadows of Liyue... Spreading rumors, wanting to get their hands on the archon's body, and what not."
Paimon: But research on the Sigil of Permission? Paimon: wonders what they're up to.
Paimon: "Speaking of which, there's also some connection between you and the Sigil of Permission, (Traveler). Seems there's still more for us to find out."
Traveller: It's all unfolding a little too perfectly.
Traveller: Ningguang: is clearly trying to steer us there.
Paimon: Oh? You really think so?
Paimon: "Well... should we not go, then?"
Traveller: "No, what I mean is..."
Paimon: "Oh, so you're saying that it's precisely because we can't completely trust Ningguang: that we should confirm the truth of what she says for ourselves."
Paimon: Hmm... That's way out of Paimon:'s league. Paimon: thinks she's been nothing but good to us.
Paimon: "Anyway, we'll see if you're on to something."
Paimon: "Um, before we look forZhongli:atDihua Marsh, let's go to the place marked out on these papers and see if the Fatui really are up to no good there."
Ningguang: "So, have you made your choice?"
Ningguang: You don't have to confirm it with me. Just choose one and take it.
Ningguang: "Afterwards, why not sit down for a while in the Jade Chamber, or have a short stroll? Rest is also an integral part of any journey."
Traveller: Thank you for your hospitality.
Ningguang: "Come now, there's no need to stand on ceremony. Loosen up a little."
Traveller: It's time we made a move. See you...
Ningguang: "Alright then, I hope the next time we meet, you will either have already done the right thing... or, will be about to make the right call."
Paimon: There really were Fatui at the location written down on this piece of paper!
Paimon: "And, uh, they look really mad at us, too!"
Paimon: "There are so many talismans here! And some stacks of blank paper, too! Hmm, what are they for?"
Traveller: It looks like they're copying the pattern on the talisman.
Traveller: Maybe they're trying to reproduce a talisman.
Paimon: Paimon:'s seen this pattern before! But where...
Paimon: "Oh, Paimon: knows! It looks just like the Sigil of Permission thatChilde:gave you."
Paimon: "Hmm, but how did a relic of theadeptiend up in the hands of someone like Childe:? Suspicious..."
Traveller: It's not just a relic...
Paimon: "Oh, that's right.Cloud Retainer:said that when theLord of Geocreated the Sigil of Permission, it wasn't to be used as some ol' relic..."
Paimon: Talismans like that were once used in theArchon Warto channel divine powers.
Paimon: Maybe the Fatui are copying the Sigil of Permission in hopes of achieving a similar effect?
Paimon: "Being able to channel divine power in battle... Whew, that sounds pretty dangerous."
Traveller: Seems the Fatui are definitely up to something.
Traveller: Maybe this paper is only a snippet of a much bigger plan.
Paimon: "And the plot thickens... We'll need to keep an eye onChilde:, that's for sure."
Paimon: "Hmm, alright, that's enough sticking around here. We gotta go meet up withZhongli:soon."
Paimon: The last stop on our Rite of Parting preparations tour is...Dihua Marsh!
Paimon: Let's go! Paimon: hates being late!
Zhongli: Right on time. I myself only arrived moments ago.
Zhongli: Did you enjoy your visit to the Jade Chamber?
Paimon: It was so biiig. And preetty. And expensive. Paimon:'s never seen such a fancy-schmancy place before!
Zhongli: Indeed. It's second to none in all of Liyue.
Zhongli: "Then you met with Ningguang:  I trust? What did you talk about with her?"
Paimon: She's super rich and so generous. Paimon: thinks she's very friendly!
Traveller: Business people are always "friendly" when it suits their interests.
Paimon: "Yeah, (his/her) take on Ningguang: is quite different from Paimon:'s. (S/he) thinks that even the tactless Yuheng is more trustworthy than her."
Zhongli: "Oh, so you also met withKeqing:  then? What did she have to say?"
Paimon: "She said, ""The time of the adepti has long passed. If even theLiyue Qixingdon't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue?"""
Zhongli: "Haha, no respect for the divine."
Zhongli: "Indeed, contrary to the ever-bold Keqing:  Ningguang: is more of a businesswoman at heart, though they are both members of the Qixing."
Zhongli: "Although she's friendly, there's no way of clearly discerning her true intentions."
Traveller: Ningguang: is highly intelligent.
Traveller: Ningguang: is highly ambitious.
Zhongli: "Yes, she has only relied on herself to rise to her current position. No ordinary person could ever achieve that."
Zhongli: "It's said that she's the one behind the constant expansion of the Jade Chamber it's the second most important thing to her. Even if she ever gave up the position of the Tianquan, she would never give up the Jade Chamber."
Paimon: The Jade Chamber is only second? What's the most important thing to her then?
Zhongli: "Why, Mora, of course."
Traveller: Makes sense.
Traveller: No surprises there.
Paimon: "All Ningguang: talked about was the Fatui this and the Fatui that... She said that after Rex Lapis was murdered, the Fatui have constantly been trying to sink their fingers into Liyue and that they aren't to be trusted."
Zhongli: That is how the Fatui have always been. It doesn't surprise me in the least.
Traveller: And now they are trying to reproduce the Sigil of Permission.
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: "No matter what they may be planning, you must be careful when dealing with the Fatui. Always be on your guard."
Paimon: So is there anything we need to get for the Rite of Parting in Dihua Marsh?
Zhongli: "Yes, as a matter of fact, there is. Today we'll be gathering wild Glaze Lilies."
Paimon: Glaze Lilies? But why did we come all the way out here? Doesn't the garden inYujing Terracehave some? EvenQingce Villagehas Glaze Lilies...
Paimon: "Oh right, Paimon: remembers thatMadame Pingis always tending to flowers, maybe we could ask her!"
Zhongli: "No, those lilies have all been gardened by people. They won't do at all."
Zhongli: Dihua Marsh used to be full of Glaze Lilies. It is a sort of joyful flower that listens to human song.
Zhongli: "Before the Archon War, Dihua Marsh was all dry land and fertile soil. But the war caused landslides and the land was flooded, turning it into the marsh you see now. Nearly all the Glaze Lilies were wiped out."
Zhongli: "Of course, there are some kinds of flowers that have been preserved and gardened by people in the city. But very few people know that Glaze Lilies may still be found in the wild."
Zhongli: "Wild Glaze Lilies have the strongest fragrance. If we want to follow the true tradition of the Rite of Parting, we must grind up the wild lilies and place the powder in the censer ofEverlasting Incense."
Zhongli: But I'll need your assistance in gathering these flowers.
Traveller: You mean you need me to pick them?
Zhongli: No. I need you to sing to them. Singing to the flowers will make them more fragrant.
Traveller: So you need me... to sing?
Zhongli: ...That's correct. Your singing will surely bring out the strongest fragrance from the flowers.
Paimon: "Uh... so how good is your singing, (Traveler)?"
Traveller: I can hold a tune.
Paimon: Really? Why doesn't Paimon: believe you...
Zhongli: We'll only know once (he/she) starts singing.
Paimon: It's time to sing! Whenever you're ready!
Traveller: *clears throat*...
Paimon: Wh—What happened...!?
Paimon: These flowers are jumping... They look really angry! Is it... because you sang a song fromMondstadtthat they don't understand here in Liyue?
Paimon: Those weren't Glaze Lilies! Glaze Lilies wouldn't hit people!
Traveller: Those flowers put up quite a fight...
Zhongli: This little monster is known as a "Whopperflower."
Zhongli: Hmm... Strange. These petals look interesting.
Zhongli: The Glaze Lilies used as a disguise were buried with the Whopperflower for too long. The result seems to have surprisingly potent medicinal value. Let's collect what we can of these petals.
Paimon: "Well that's nice and all, but will those petals be useful for the Rite of Parting?"
Zhongli: "Unfortunately, no."
Paimon: "Ugh, that's so lame..."
Ganyu: Excuse me...
Ganyu: Are you searching for Glaze Lilies?
Paimon: "Oh, hey! It's... what's her face... Ah, Paimon: can't remember..."
Traveller: "Greetings,Ganyu:."
Ganyu: "Hello, traveler. I'm surprised you still remember my name."
Traveller: "Greetings, Yangu."
Ganyu: "Yangu"? Wh—Who's that?
Ganyu: "Eh... You've completely forgotten my name, haven't you?"
Ganyu: "Ah! That reminds me, how was your visit to the Jade Chamber?"
Paimon: "Well, it sure would've been better if you'd told us how to get up there!"
Ganyu: Didn't I tell you the way!? Surely I did!
Paimon: "Nope, we found the way on our own!"
Traveller: "It isn't a secret, so perhaps you just assumed we knew?"
Traveller: Guess it was our fault for not asking.
Ganyu: "Oh, I see."
Ganyu: "(Uh-oh, I guess I really did forget to tell them...)"
Paimon: "Huh, something seems a little off about Ganyu:..."
Paimon: She's acting different from the first time we met... Where's her serious attitude now?
Ganyu: "Ah, well, I met you at that time as an emissary of the Tianquan. But now, I am simply out on a stroll to see the flowers."
Paimon: You came all the way out here to see the flowers? Why not just enjoy the gardens of the city?
Ganyu: ...
Ganyu: "Yujing Terrace is where Rex Lapis parted from this world. If I strolled through those lonely gardens now, I wouldn't be able to bear it."
Ganyu: "Whenever my duties take me near Yujing Terrace these days, I draw the windows to block my view of the gardens."
Paimon: "Oh... Sorry, we shouldn't have brought it up."
Ganyu: "No, it's quite alright. I just haven't processed my emotions yet."
Ganyu: "When the Archon War came to its end two thousand years ago, the first iteration of The Seven would gather in Liyue and drink with Rex Lapis. But five of those original seven had already passed before Rex Lapis — it's truly a changing of the guard."
Traveller: So that means...
Ganyu: "Yes. Now that the spirit of Rex Lapis has returned to the heavens, only Barbatos of Mondstadt remains of the first Seven."
Ganyu: "The other five, including Inazuma's Raiden Shogun, are no longer the same friends from two thousands years ago."
Ganyu: "Of the current Seven Archons, the youngest is Sumeru's God of Dendro. He is merely five hundred years old, whereas Rex Lapis was more than six thousand years old at the time of his passing."
Ganyu: "This means that Liyue had been under Rex Lapis' rule from the moment it was first founded 3,700 years ago. The city has never had to bid farewell to its deity..."
Zhongli: "So, what do you think of this ""farewell""?"
Ganyu: "Huh? This... This is a little sudden, I..."
Ganyu: ...
Ganyu: "As a mortal, I've never dared to imagine a Liyue without Rex Lapis."
Ganyu: "But as an adeptus... I think I will eventually come to grips with reality. Since Rex Lapis has passed, the time of Liyue's contract with the gods and adepti has now reached its end."
Paimon: "Huh? Did you just say, ""as an adeptus""?"
Ganyu: "Yes, I... I am a mix of human and Qilin. Adeptus blood flows through my veins. I fought for Rex Lapis and the city of Liyue during the Archon War."
Ganyu: "After the war ended, I signed a contract with Rex Lapis and took the position as secretary for the Qixing. I've continued those duties to this very day."
Traveller: So you're half Qilin? That explains the horns!
Traveller: So you're how old!? That explains the forgetfulness!
Ganyu: "Well... uh, let's save that conversation for another day. You say that you are here looking for Glaze Lilies?"
Ganyu: "I also know where wild Glaze Lilies can be found. See, I've just picked one myself. Here, you may have it if you wish."
Zhongli: We dare not refuse it.
Paimon: "Oh, so did you sing a song before you picked the lily?"
Ganyu: "Indeed, I did. I know this tradition well. In fact, I sang a local Liyue ballad to it."
Paimon: "Wow, so you really know your stuff too! Thanks, Ganyu:!"
Ganyu: "No, it is you who I should be thanking. If not for this chance meeting, I never thought that I would be able to contribute to the upcoming farewell for our ancient lord."
Ganyu: "If you would excuse me, I should return to my work now. Good luck."
Zhongli: And that just about does it. Our preparations for the Rite of Parting are mostly finished.
Zhongli: "Given the ease of picking Glaze Lilies, I think this was a fitting end to our tasks, in more ways than one."
Traveller: "Zhongli:  you seem suited to working in agricultural development."
Paimon: "Yeah, Paimon: can already imagine him starting a business in Liyue."
Zhongli: "Hah, I've had enough ventures in my life already."
Zhongli: "Beginning a new undertaking is always difficult at first and requires no small amount of effort. And once business is at full steam, the stress of it all only wears away at you over time."
Zhongli: "So you must be careful to take the time to step back and reexamine yourself. If left unchecked, the wear and tear on your heart may go well past mending."
Paimon: "Wow! See, Zhongli: sounds like he's already seen it all!"
Paimon: "Alright, I think it's about time we head back to Liyue Harbor now."
Paimon: "Huh, what happened? The city gate is swarming with Millelith and... the Fatui?"
Zhongli: This atmosphere is highly abnormal. It seems as though something big has happened.
Zhongli: "We should ask around a little, just to be safe."
Felix,"Ah, you're the consultant to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor — Mr. Zhongli:  I presume?"
Felix,"The Millelith are watching our every move now. These are desperate times, we mustn't act rashly."
Zhongli: Desperate times?
Felix,The adepti of Jueyun Karst are finally on the move.
Zhongli: Do they intend to exercise force?
Felix,"Most likely. I've heard that some members of the Qixing have already gone to meet them... Well, I say ""meet,"" but it's more like they're attempting to stall the adepti outside the city."
Felix,"However, both sides were quite obsinate, and hit an impasse."
Zhongli: "...It seems inevitable, given the current situation."
Felix,"The adepti do not acknowledge the Qixing, they only acknowledge the contracts of the Geo Archon. If the two sides come to blows, Liyue Harbor will be in no position to stop them."
Zhongli: Surely the Liyue Qixing are not the sort to give in so easily?
Felix,Hmph. Their bone-headedness is known throughout the lands. Yet it's because of that obstinacy that mortals and adepti are now on the verge of conflict.
Zhongli: And what now? How is it that the Fatui have come under fire?
Felix,Ugh... that's all Ningguang:'s doing...
Felix,"She proclaimed that ""in these tumultuous times, the Millelith must rein in the actions of the Fatui."""
Felix,Only now do they want to start keeping tabs on us? Huh! That's the Qixing for you!
Felix,"Anyway, Mr. Zhongli:  you're one of Childe:'s close associates. Please understand that your actions will reflect on us. Don't let anyone catch you off-guard."
Paimon: It looks like things are about to boil over in Liyue Harbor...
Traveller: Is there anything can we do?
Traveller: We can't just stand by and watch.
Zhongli: "Do you intend to use your neutral identity as an intermediary between both sides? Or, will you use your sword to turn the balance?"
Zhongli: Neither path is an easy one...
Felix,"Oh, by the way, Mr. Zhongli:. We've heard that the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has also been caught up in all this. They're currently squaring off with the authorities at the gates."
Zhongli: Things are taking a turn for the worse...
Zhongli: I'm afraid I must leave now to handle things back at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. I hope thatDirector Huhas been able to keep things under control for the moment.
Zhongli: "Consider your next course of action carefully, (Traveler). If you're trying to prevent an explosion, it may be wisest to look for the fuse first."
Paimon: Phew... Having connections with the Fatui seems to be quite the double-edged sword.
Paimon: So what did Zhongli: mean by looking for the "fuse"?
Traveller: Childe:.
Traveller: That ginger guy.
Traveller: "You know, Mr. More-Money-Than-Sense."
Paimon: "Ooh, Paimon: gets it! If there's anyone that wants to see the whole city turned upside down, it's definitely him."
Paimon: He must be waiting for the moment when no-one is watching to do something really bad!
Paimon: "But, where could we find him now?"
Paimon: Where would he go at a time like this?
Traveller: Follow me.
Traveller: There's only once place he would go.
Felix,The Liyue Qixing... to think that they'd go for us Fatui the first chance they got...
Felix,"Once the adepti send the Qixing packing, we'll just set up foreign relations with them instead!"
Paimon: Wow... This is theGolden House?
Paimon: It looked impressive enough from the outside... But who would've guessed that it was even fancier on the inside... and so full of Mora!!!
Paimon: "This is where all of Teyvat's Mora is minted, right? In that case, maybe they won't notice if a few Mora go missing..."
Traveller: Touch a single Mora and we're done for!
Traveller: "If it were that easy, this place would have been emptied long ago."
Paimon: "Ooh, so it's a trap. Tricky, tricky... Good thing Paimon:'s got you here!"
Paimon: "But even if we can't take any, we can still have a closer look, right?"
Paimon: "Or better yet, take a nap on top of a mountain of Mora! It's like a dream come true!"
Traveller: We'd better check on the Exuvia first.
Traveller: Something feels amiss here.
Paimon: "Oh, right! Back to business."
Paimon: It's quiet... Too quiet. Surely someone's gotta be guarding something as important as the Exuvia.
Paimon: "Huh!? (Traveler), look! What happened here?"
Traveller: The Millelith...
Traveller: They've been knocked unconscious!
Paimon: "Uh-oh, Paimon: smells trouble!"
Paimon: Quick! We have to go make sure that the Exuvia is alright.
Childe:,"You've already fulfilled your task as guides, so why do you still linger here? Haven't you already seen enough trouble for today?"
Paimon: Huh? Who's there?
Childe:,"If you were Fatui, I imagine that you would be entitled to a generous reward from the Tsaritsa herself."
Childe:,"But now, you're nothing but dross — and you're in my way."
Traveller: How did you find out it was here?
Childe:,"Hmm, where should I start? Well, I've never been one to beat around the bush, you know. But who could have possibly guessed that the God of Geo would mysteriously perish the very moment I arrived in Liyue, and that the Exuvia would subsequently be hidden away?"
Childe:,"If it weren't for that lovely little Rite of Parting ceremony you put together, it would have taken me a whole lot longer to get the information I needed."
Traveller: "Looks like I was just in time, then."
Childe:,Hah! Although I'm deeply grateful to you that I was able to effortlessly find this secret location...
Childe:,Don't you think that trying to stop me now would just be wasted effort?
Childe:,"Stopping the Mora mints, hiding away the Exuvia... Hahaha, the Qixing are really pulling out all the stops this time..."
Paimon: So you've been planning to take the Gnosis from inside the Exuvia all along!?
Childe:,"As one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, it's my duty to see the will of the Tsaritsa fulfilled."
Childe:,She will get that which she desires.
Traveller: Not if I have anything to say about it.
Traveller: I won't allow you to get near the Exuvia.
Childe:,"Hah! I'm not asking for your blessing, and there's nothing you can do to stop me anyway."
Childe:,"The time for discussion and diplomacy has already passed. I mean, if it were up to me, I would have skipped that stage to begin with... but I'm willing to do as the Tsaritsa deems fit."
Childe:,"Either way — we now come to my favorite part. A simple pleasure, and one that I am oh-so-delighted to be sharing with you..."
Childe:,The battle.
Paimon: "Battle? So you're the type that goes looking for trouble, huh?"
Childe:,"Haha, you could say that."
Childe:,"When Signora offended the deities outside the Cathedral in Mondstadt, she swiftly left the scene once her mission was accomplished."
Childe:,"Instead of confronting you directly, she chose to rely on the snow and ice to make her escape. She wouldn't want the Knights to come running towards the sound of battle, now, would she?"
Childe:,"When she faces a worthy opponent, she will prioritize her mission, weigh the outcomes, and consider the consequences of her actions..."
Childe:,"But as for me, the greatest pleasure of being a Harbinger lies in crossing blades with strong opponents."
Paimon: We won't let what happened in Mondstadt ever happen again!
Childe:,"Oh? So you intend to fight me? Good. I won't kill you, Traveler. I'll just play along — to feel the thrill of battle![Note 1]"
Childe:,"Besides, you could never defeat me. Not even in your wildest dreams. But hey, try to relish the fight anyway. Because if you ask me... without that, what else is there?"
Traveller: I could never defeat you!? You're completely delusional.
Childe:,Ahahahaha!
Childe:,"Fighting talk, I love it! Now, let's see you live up to it."
Childe:,"This chance is hard to come by, so show me all you've got."
Childe:,So very few ever get the chance to square off with a Fatui Harbinger.
Childe:,"So come now, amuse me... and don't you dare disappoint."
Childe:,Good! No wonder Signora was so wary of you.
Childe:,"Well, that just means I can go all out! Brace yourselves, this is about to get tough..."
Childe:,"Now, show me what you can do against the might of a Harbinger."
Childe:,Not bad. Your swordsmanship is quite impressive.
Childe:,"But, that's about as far as you'll get."
Childe:,Haha...
Childe:,Didn't think you had that card hidden up your sleeve...
Paimon: You were just playing us to get close to the Exuvia!
Childe:,"Oh, quiet down. Stop acting like some wide-eyed recruit."
Childe:,You've seen this world. You of all people should know...
Childe:,This should have been expected.
Childe:,"Well then, I'll be taking Morax's Gnosis now!"
Childe:,...Huh?
Childe:,"Hahaha... I see. Well, this is most unexpected."
Childe:,"You... You beat me to it, didn't you?"
Childe:,Not bad!
Childe:,But this is going to cost you!
Paimon: Aaaah!!!
Childe:,"You got to the Gnosis ahead of me, didn't you!?"
Childe:,Did you simply move faster? Or... did you leak the information regarding the Golden House to me on purpose?
Childe:,No matter. Hand the Gnosis over. Now. Don't make me take it from you.
Paimon: W—We didn't take it!
Childe:,*panting*
Paimon: Look! Childe:'s back to normal again.
Childe:,"Ugh, well then... time to cool off."
Childe:,It seems the burden of the Foul Legacy Transformation was too great for my body. I lacked the opportunity to think this through...
Childe:,"And now that I consider the matter more carefully, you never had any chance of beating me to the Gnosis."
Childe:,"You had no connection to the Gnosis, no matter where it had been taken."
Paimon: That's right! We tried to tell you we didn't take it!
Childe:,"Your show of ability today far surpasses that of Signora's initial assessment of you in Mondstadt. Tell me, how could that be?"
Traveller: (Because I'm collecting the powers of the seven elements...)
Traveller: (Because I'm gradually restoring my former powers...)
Childe:,"You already know the answer, don't you? I can see it in your eyes."
Childe:,"But if that is a secret you wish to keep, I guess I'll just have to curb my curiosity."
Childe:,The battle has already left me satisfied.
Childe:,"Anyone who strives as I do to grow stronger shall be called a friend, even if our friendship can only be shown in battle against one another."
Paimon: Pretty sure that's not the normal way to make friends.
Childe:,"Unfortunately, I must bring this amiable conversation to an end. My quest still beckons."
Childe:,"Given the Gnosis wasn't taken by anyone, then we must look once again to the beginning. Perhaps it was never in the Exuvia to begin with."
Childe:,"In fact, it might be that the Exuvia was just a diversion of sorts."
Paimon: What? So you mean that...
Traveller: Rex Lapis still lives?
Traveller: The corpse was fake?
Childe:,"Yes, it appears so. Interesting to say the least..."
Childe:,It seems that the guardian deity of the capital of commerce is also well-versed in the little maneuvers beyond the boundaries of contracts.
Childe:,"As such, we must now look to our backup plan."
Paimon: Backup plan?
Childe:,"I had hoped it would never come to this, for the weak will be swept away in the process."
Childe:,"The truth is, the world belongs to those who pursue strength. I seldom willingly involve myself with the weak."
Childe:,"Unfortunately, we cannot be picky about our methods as Fatui Harbingers. Children must all learn to eat their vegetables sometime."
Paimon: "So, what are you planning to do?"
Childe:,I will awaken the god that lies dormant beneath Guyun Stone Forest.
Paimon: A god!?
Childe:,"Osial, Overlord of the Vortex, who was defeated by Morax the Geo Archon in the Archon War, and who has remained pinned beneath the waves by the Geo Archon's stone spears ever since."
Childe:,"If such an ancient god were to be unleashed upon Liyue Harbor, defenseless without the protection of its deity..."
Childe:,Do you think the cunning Rex Lapis would just stand aloof and watch the ensuing destruction?
Paimon: But... the Archon War ended two thousand years ago! How could an ancient god appear in a world now overseen by The Seven?
Childe:,Simple! I've already prepared the means to awaken it.
Paimon: Hey! Those are Sigils of Permission!
Paimon: "Oh, Paimon: remembers now! The Fatui have been researching them..."
Traveller: I saw your research with my own eyes.
Traveller: You've been trying to duplicate them.
Childe:,Indeed. The one that was given to you was just a by-product of our research.
Childe:,"With the power of so many Sigils of Permission concentrated in one place, along with that which was bestowed upon me as a Harbinger by our Tsaritsa... Breaking the subduing might of the Geo Archon's spears for a time should be no obstacle."
Childe:,Using the powers of ancient gods in such a situation fails to interest me and is largely against my principles.
Childe:,"But knowing that such an action will not only force the Geo Archon to show its hand, but you as well... That makes matters a little more intriguing."
Childe:,Hahahahaha! Let's see — will the nation that has lost its deity be swallowed up by an ancient malice once more?
Childe:,If you wish to drown together with the people of Liyue
Childe:,You're free to stay and enjoy the show!
Paimon: Huh? He—He's already gone!
Paimon: That guy is fast...
Paimon: Wha—What's going on!?
Paimon: *panting* Paimon:'s exhausted...
Paimon: "If we hadn't happened to see the Jade Chamber flying over just as we came out of the Golden House, we really wouldn't have known which way to go..."
Paimon: "Whew, did we make it in time? Is the Overlord of the Vortex still in the sea? It hasn't destroyed Liyue yet, has it?"
Xiao: What... are you doing here?
Paimon: Huh... Hold on! It's the adepti! What are you doing on the Jade Chamber? Paimon: thought you were arguing with the Qixing... Is the fighting over?
Ningguang: "Faced with such a calamity of such magnitude, we have agreed to put our differences aside for now and unit against this common enemy."
Moon Carver,Hmph!
Paimon: "Oh, Paimon: gets it... So, how do you plan to defend Liyue?"
Paimon: "Uhh... just seeing this Overlord of the Vortex guy puts a pit in Paimon:'s tummy, even from all the way out here."
Keqing: It's not just you. We've got new Millelith recruits who can't even stand at attention without shaking. The force of an ancient god's presence seems to be too much for ordinary people to handle.
Keqing: ...Which is why we must stop that monster before it gets any closer to Liyue Harbor!
Paimon: So the Archon War was fought two thousand years ago against enemies like that thing? Now that's scary...
Xiao: ...
Paimon: "So will the power of the Qixing, Millelith, and Adepti gathered here be enough to stop that god?"
Ningguang: "We've already discussed this together, and our conclusion is... not necessarily."
Paimon: What!? But all of you are supposed to be the guardians of Liyue. Can't you think of something?
Cloud Retainer: One certainly could.
Paimon: Eh?
Cloud Retainer: The Qixing did once research the matter of the Guizhong Ballista when it piqued their fancy.
Cloud Retainer: "And as fate would have it, one, who did craft the Guizhong Ballista with one's own hands, is here..."
Cloud Retainer: For what could you mortals ever learn of adepti mechanisms? Yet it would take one but a little tinkering to turn this ballista into an engine of war beyond your wildest thoughts.
Ningguang: "Heh, I suppose this is one blessing from the adepti that we should be thankful for."
Ningguang: So be it. We shall use the upgraded Guizhong Ballista to fight off that god. All the adepti here can lend their strength to man it.
Ningguang: We haven't a moment to spare. Our battle begins now!
Paimon: The Fatui!
Paimon: They're attacking the Guizhong Ballista!
Millelith Soldier,The three adepti are manning the Guizhong Ballistas. Do not let the Fatui disturb their work!
Keqing: "All able Millelith, with me!"
Paimon: Let's go help too!
Cloud Retainer: We adepti have not faced a god in several millenia.
Cloud Retainer: "Hmph. Let one see what you are made of then. What strength remains within you, one wishes to witness!"
Paimon: What is that!?
Xiao: That is Osial's divine power. I am... very familiar with it.
Xiao: Be careful not to get hit.
Millelith Soldier,The Fatui... their attacks are unrelenting!
Ningguang: Ha. How daring. Snezhnaya's diplomats will answer for this afterward. Every last one.
Paimon: The ancient god's attacking again!
Paimon: "There are so many Fatui, too! We can't hold—"
Madame Ping,"Hahaha, were you about to say, ""we can't hold them,"" children?"
Paimon: Huh?
Madame Ping,"Don't lose heart. Here, take this."
Paimon: This is... adeptal energy!?
Paimon: "(Traveler), that light from your body... It's like that time in Jueyun Karst..."
Paimon: "Wow, it's Madame Ping's Shockwave! This granny's really strong!"
Ganyu: "With the blood of the Qilin, I guard you against evil."
Ganyu: Cast your fear of injury by the wayside and fight with all your might. I too did this during the Archon War.
Paimon: Huh... So this is what Ganyu:'s like in a fight...
Xiao: My name means "swiftness."
Xiao: "Take my power, and run as I do."
Paimon: We're— going— too— faaaaast—!
Madame Ping,"Child, you are strong in body and spirit. Perhaps you can withstand three forms of adeptal energy at once..."
Ganyu: This will hurt a little... Please bear with us!
Xiao: "Once you've adapted, try to use them in battle."
Ganyu: Exercise caution! I fear that the god's power has reached its peak...
Keqing: "In other words, if we hold here, there's nothing worse to come, right?"
Keqing: The Fatui's numbers are thinning!
Millelith Soldier,"Fight on, comrades! Once we've finished this lot off, the adepti will be able to deal with the god in peace!"
Moon Carver,The interlopers are no more
Moon Carver,Now we may commit ourselves fully!
Paimon: Ah! It's working!
Paimon: We just need to keep this up!
Xiao: Be careful now
Cloud Retainer: The Guizhong Ballista is destroyed...
Cloud Retainer: "Without its covering fire, retaliation shall be difficult"
Ganyu: But the Jade Chamber is our last line of defense!
Ganyu: We can't give another inch... no matter what...
Ningguang: I have... another idea
Ganyu: "What do you mean, Lady Ningguang:?"
Ningguang: I'll sacrifice the Jade Chamber
Xiao: What is the meaning of this?
Xiao: ...I understand
Ningguang: "Traveler, lend me a hand"
Ningguang: "Farewell, old friend..."
Ningguang: ...Goodbye for now
Ningguang: Let us meet again in the future
Paimon: Is it... finally over?
Moon Carver,The ominous aura of that monster has indeed begun to fade.
Moon Carver,The effects of the Sigil of Permission last but a short time.
Moon Carver,It will be some time before the Overlord of the Vortex can make any waves again.
Ningguang: "We are indebted to you for your assistance. If the adepti hadn't happened to be here, the future of Liyue Harbor would surely have been in great jeopardy..."
Cloud Retainer: "Hmph, save your flattery. We didn't just ""happen"" to be here... Surely you won't pretend to have forgotten the reason for which we came?"
Madame Ping,"Come now, there's no need for such harsh words, Cloud Retainer:."
Madame Ping,"I've heard that when Ningguang: began learning to do business, she had already started setting aside part of her then-limited income in preparation for building the Jade Chamber."
Madame Ping,"At first, it was only the size of a small room. But with continued expansion, it has become the palace that lies before you now."
Madame Ping,"It is a testament to Ningguang:'s entire life, both as a businesswoman and as the backbone of the Liyue Qixing."
Madame Ping,"Seeing the Jade Chamber destroyed in the defense of Liyue means much to her. To me, such cooperation and sacrifice deserves at least some recognition, don't you agree?"
Ningguang: "Well, I was really hoping you would say that such sacrifice could at least be used as some leverage in our negotiations."
Madame Ping,...Heh.
Ningguang: "Thank you all for hearing me out. We know very well why the adepti came here today... But please forgive us, we cannot yield to your wishes."
Moon Carver,Oh?
Ningguang: "3,700 years... According to our records, the adepti signed a contract with Rex Lapis to protect Liyue 3,700 years ago."
Ningguang: "Even to this very day, Liyue and its lands have stood the test of time, immovable as stone, just as it was thousands of years before. This is truly no small feat."
Ningguang: But that does not mean that Liyue today is the same city as it was all those years ago.
Ningguang: "Do not merely cast your protective gaze upon the land. Instead, focus your sights on our city and each of the citizens that dwell within it."
Moon Carver,Are you questioning our means of protecting Liyue?
Mountain Shaper,Hmm...
Ningguang: I mean no offense. I simply hope that our new adepti forebearers would see Liyue in a new light.
Cloud Retainer: "Hah, ""forebearers"" you say. One doubts you would be fit to be part of such a lineage..."
Ningguang: "This morning, Rex Lapis appeared to me in a dream."
Cloud Retainer: What?
Ningguang: "In the dream, I yearned to tell him that we Qixing, though mortal, are equally bound to the contract. Each passing generation of the Qixing leaves many things of value to be inherited by the next generation."
Ningguang: "I also thought to tell him how the past generations of Qixing had strove under his rule to survive in our mortal world, establishing a network of contracts which has since come to be known as ""trade."""
Ningguang: But I dared not speak. I could only gaze at him in silence until the moment I awoke.
Paimon: "Aw, Ningguang:..."
Traveller: We're all on the same side here...
Cloud Retainer: "Yet another perspective... What are you trying to say, Outlander?"
Traveller: When there is discord between the guardians and those they were meant to defend...
Traveller: Harmony becomes very difficult to restore.
Paimon: "Right, that's something that happened in Mondstadt — it's a story about the Four Winds and the people of the Anemo Archon."
Paimon: "The Anemo Archon sought to quell the strife between the two sides, because he believed that such conflict would only scar the hearts of both and that nothing good would come of it..."
Traveller: This is what we learned in the City of Freedom.
Keqing: Each of the Seven Nations has its own scars from the past.
Mountain Shaper,Though your point is the very height of simplicity...
Mountain Shaper,"As adepti, we've become a laughingstock, to be chastised thus by an outlander who has lent us such succor."
Madame Ping,"Alright, alright. Didn't Ningguang: suggest that we should focus on the city and each of its citizens? I know I already have, so why not see for yourselves?"
Fengyan,I apologize for appearing in full armor. I'm afraid I cannot show the proper courtesies.
Moon Carver,And who are you?
Fengyan,"I am Fengyan, a sergeant of the Millelith. I have come to extend my thanks to the adepti."
Fengyan,"I thought this battle would perhaps be my last. But thanks to the aid of the adepti, our forces were not as badly battered as I feared we might be."
Fengyan,"Although I am a mere mortal soldier, I promise to hold the line and never betray the grace given to us by the illuminated adepti this day."
Moon Carver,...
Xiao: ...
Changchang,Huh? Why does everyone look so down? Didn't we just beat that big monster?
Madame Ping,"Hahaha! Weren't you frightened, dear? It was quite the predicament..."
Changchang,"I wasn't afraid. All the strong Millelith guards were there, and those powerful heroes with their Visions were there... Everyone was there!"
Changchang,"When danger is near, everyone always protects me. And the rest of the time, they make fun toys, and tasty snacks, and... and loads of things that make the harbor so pretty!"
Changchang,Thanks for protecting Liyue Harbor! Please come visit us for the next Lantern Rite!
Xiao: "Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to participate."
Changchang,Huh?
Xiao: Because we are adepti.
Changchang,"Oh, okay... It must be hard being an adeptus."
Paimon: Aww...
Madame Ping,"You see, this is what Liyue is like today."
Madame Ping,The country of contracts is grateful to the adepti for their protection. But it is no longer necessary for the city to rely on the adepti's power to solve every little niggling matter.
Madame Ping,"Although their blood is weak, there is still strength to be found in those we call mortals..."
Madame Ping,The time of contracts between gods and Liyue has long since passed. Now is the time of contracts between Liyue and its people.
Mountain Shaper,"Hmm, seeing the port around us now, it is hard not to feel a bit out of place... wouldn't you say so, Cloud Retainer:?"
Cloud Retainer: Your line of inquiry is askew. One did not spearhead this expedition to Liyue Harbor...
Paimon: Hmm... seems like the adepti have had a change of heart.
Traveller: They've listened to what the people have said.
Traveller: And they're trying to understand things from their perspective.
Xiao: Let us return now.
Moon Carver,"...Eager to leave, Conqueror of Demons?"
Madame Ping,Hehehe...
Mountain Shaper,"Yes, one understands what the Conqueror of Demons means. The city of Liyue has changed much after our long separation."
Mountain Shaper,"One fears that by the time one finally grasps the new contracts of Liyue, you humans would have once again changed the place beyond recognition."
Mountain Shaper,"Fair enough. Away we shall, and return whence we came..."
Moon Carver,Hmph...
Moon Carver,"Since we adepti have consensus, then one shall persist no further."
Moon Carver,"But how will we ensure that the Liyue Qixing will not simply exploit their power once we depart? In my view, that is still a thing to be guarded against..."
Ningguang: *chuckles*
Madame Ping,"Alright, Moon Carver. You needn't worry. It seems to me that this right of supervision is best left to the people of Liyue."
Paimon: "Whew... Looks like the conflict between humans and adepti was avoided. All's well that ends well, huh?"
Traveller: You can say that again...
Traveller: The adepti were quite reasonable in the end...
Paimon: "Oh, right! It's nice that we've got peace and all, but we're forgetting one thing!"
Paimon: Childe: wanted to unleash the god so he could lure Rex Lapis out!
Paimon: But we were able to handle the Overlord of the Vortex on our own... So Rex Lapis never showed up!
Paimon: "Oh, and speaking of that — don't we still need to get to the bottom of that archon's ""death,"" too?"
Paimon: "Paimon: doesn't get it... But, isn't the strongest lead we have the adepti-less Rite of Parting that we're organizing?"
Paimon: No idea where Zhongli:'s gone. Let's ask for him atWangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Ferrylady,Is there anything I can do for you two? I'm afraid that Wangsheng Funeral Parlor isn't in the best state to receive guests.
Paimon: We've come to see Zhongli:. Could you please tell him we're here?
Ferrylady,"Unfortunately, Zhongli: isn't here at the moment. It seems he went to Northland Bank."
Paimon: Doesn't the Northland Bank belong to the Fatui?
Paimon: Last time we saw Zhongli: was before we went to the Golden House...
Paimon: Do you think he doesn't know about the attack on Liyue? Visiting the Fatui at a time like this could only mean more trouble!
Paimon: We had better go and make sure that everything is okay.
Ferrylady,"Come to think of it, I wonder what business Mr. Zhongli: has at the Northland Bank? He didn't tell me, either..."
Childe:,"You call this ""cooperation between Harbingers""? Cooperation involves communication, you know..."
Signora,"Hehe, don't take it to heart, Childe:. Besides, weren't you happy that you got to skip the formalities and bring chaos to the land? I'm sure you must've enjoyed that..."
Signora,"...Oh, it seems that some of your friends have arrived."
Paimon: "Hey, it's Zhongli: and Childe:! And... you! You're also one of the Harbingers..."
Traveller: Signora!
Signora,"Haha, it's you two. I believe we've met once before... In the City of Bards, was it? I'm glad you still remember my name."
Signora,"Ah, right. I imagine that it must have been rather hard to forget watching helplessly as something precious was snatched away from your friend."
Traveller: (Breathe... Just stay calm.)
Traveller: I still have time to take it back.
Paimon: "No, don't let her get to you, (Traveler)..."
Paimon: "You've yet to gather the powers of all seven elements, and our last battle at the Golden House was almost more than you could handle..."
Paimon: "So it might be best to keep things peaceful this time, seeing that two of the Harbingers are here."
Childe:,"Well, if it isn't (Traveler). This is our first time seeing each other since Liyue was nearly wiped off the map. This is certainly a bit... awkward, wouldn't you say?"
Paimon: "Hmph, Paimon: knew that we should never have trusted a Fatui Harbinger."
Childe:,"Aw, now don't say that. Sure, I may have misled you, but I never had anything against you personally..."
Childe:,"Besides, I thought we were getting along quite well together, didn't you? Except for that little tussle we had at the end... Haha."
Childe:,"Nothing personal, we just have... different views, that's all. Of course, you may very well hold this against me, but that's up to you..."
Childe:,The real deceivers here are Signora and Zhongli:... curse them for leading me on.
Traveller: Zhongli: tricked you?
Traveller: Signora and Zhongli:?
Childe:,"So actually, I think—"
Signora,"Stop wasting time, Childe:. There'll be plenty of time to chat once I'm through here."
Signora,"You remember the agreement, Morax. Now, if you would be so kind... TheGnosis, please."
Traveller: Agreement?
Traveller: Gnosis?
Paimon: What in the world are you talking about!?
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: "The contract is fulfilled. That which thou seeketh is now bestowed unto thee, for my promise is solid as stone."
Signora,"Hmph, how sanctimonious..."
Traveller: So Zhongli: is actually Rex Lapis?
Traveller: "I mean, I did have my suspicions..."
Paimon: What! So you're the Lord of Geo?
Paimon: "No, wait! That's an exciting twist and all — but why give the Gnosis to the Fatui!?"
Zhongli: I do not give it for free. I give it as agreed upon in the contract... for it is a matter solely between the Tsaritsa and I.
Traveller: I'm afraid I don't understand...
Traveller: And why did you feign your death?
Paimon: "Yeah, you don't think you went a little bit too far with that whole fake death thing!? Everyone was preparing the ceremony for you when splat, this big dragon falls out of the sky and all of Liyue goes into an uproar. Talk about a disaster!"
Signora,"Hehe... Gathering all the forces that had been bubbling behind the scenes, and then stirring them together in a pot that was bound to boil over... That's what he wanted to see, am I right?"
Paimon: Wait... what?
Zhongli: Perhaps it's best that I explain.
Zhongli: "As you know, I've dwelt upon this world for more than six thousand years. I witnessed the founding of Liyue together with the adepti three thousand seven hundred years ago."
Zhongli: Even boulders that can withstand whirlpools will erode with the passing of time. I kept convincing myself that cracks had not begun to form and that the end of my time had not yet come.
Zhongli: "Until one drizzly day, as I was strolling along the harbor, I heard a merchant tell one of his workers, ""You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day."""
Zhongli: "I stood motionless among the crowds, asking myself, ""Have I already finished my duties?"""
Paimon: "Oh, Zhongli:..."
Zhongli: "But as I began to consider relinquishing my divine role, I soon discovered that many reasons still remained to not hastily depart."
Zhongli: "Was Liyue, the city I had dwelt in for so long, already prepared to enter its next age? I decided that a test was needed in order to reveal the answer."
Zhongli: "So I feigned my own death, and gathered the cast of Childe:, the adepti, and the Liyue Qixing to play their roles together on the stage that was Liyue."
Traveller: "So, were you satisfied with the finale?"
Zhongli: "Indeed, I was. The Gnosis I had kept for so many years suddenly seemed to have lost its meaning."
Traveller: Let me guess — you had another plan in case it all burned down.
Zhongli: "That's right, which is why I continued to safeguard the Gnosis until now."
Paimon: "So you mean that if the chaos ever reached the point of no return, you would simply appear and use your divine powers to bring Liyue back under control?"
Signora,"Of course. And it would have been all too easy for him, too."
Signora,"Just as a child quickly matures after losing their parents, so has Liyue matured when faced with the death of its deity..."
Zhongli: "I was pleasantly surprised with the finale of the show that you all put on. Why, you even deserved an encore."
Zhongli: "The adepti deserve the greatest applause, considering their years of seclusion... They hardly recognized the city. Yet, faced with such a crisis, they exerted the greatest amount of restraint. Not only did they manage to cooperate with the Qixing, but in the end, they even tried to understand the heart of the people."
Zhongli: "And hats off to the emissary dispatched by the Cryo Archon to fulfill our contract, Signora. She managed to keep everything she knew in strict confidence, far from the eavesdropping ears of her colleague, Childe:, just as I had requested."
Zhongli: "All the while, I carried on as Zhongli: and fulfilled the traditions of Liyue in this mortal form. Thank you for walking that path with me, Traveler."
Zhongli: These things were all a part of my script. The only unforeseen plot twist was the conduct of the Liyue Qixing.
Zhongli: I had expected them to do no more than the adepti... To come to the defense of Liyue. But when all was said and done...
Zhongli: "They seized the opportunity to supplant Liyue's divine protectors, and used the subsequent power vacuum left by my death to quickly gain complete control of Liyue."
Paimon: Huh? That doesn't sound good at all!
Zhongli: "Hah... On the contrary, I think it is excellent. I had always feared that it was far too soon for them to take over from me, and it was also that which I longed for the most. As such, this is the best parting gift anyone could have given this god of old."
Childe:,"Hey, what about me? Doesn't anyone feel the least bit of remorse for deceiving me? You've practically kept me in the dark!"
Signora,"Heh, I think that thanks would be more appropriate. You certainly played no small part in all of this... Wreaking havoc and turning the city upside down. The Lord of Geo ought to thank you for your performance, if anything."
Signora,"If you hadn't created the pressure of a battle between mortals, adepti, and a god, the lump of coal resting in the hands of the Geo Archon — Liyue — would never have been able to become a dazzling diamond of a city."
Childe:,"Huh? Just whose side are you on, mocking me like that? Are you itching for a fight?"
Traveller: We were both equally fooled.
Childe:,"Be that as it may, you've come out of this as the hero of Liyue. I, on the other hand, will forever be proscribed as a disturber of peace, no?"
Traveller: You've really embarrassed yourself this time.
Childe:,Hey! Haven't you learned the Liyue saying? "Don't always call it as you see it"!
Signora,"Well then, with the Gnosis in my possession, I have no use for such idle chatter. We should return to Zapolyarny Palace and seek an audience with Her Majesty, the Tsaritsa. Come, Childe:."
Childe:,"Ugh, fine... I'll meet you there later. I'm not sharing a boat with the likes of you."
Signora,"Hmph, do as you wish."
Zhongli: "Now then, is there anything else you wish to ask me?"
Traveller: I'd like to know what the Cryo Archon offered you.
Traveller: What could possibly be worth a Gnosis?
Paimon: "Right! As Zhongli: always told us, ""a good trade is a fair trade."" Paimon: has no idea what could be a good trade for a Gnosis."
Zhongli: "Realistically speaking, there is no such thing."
Paimon: Huh???
Zhongli: "However, I am the God of Contracts. For thousands of years, I have made countless contracts. If the deal was of no benefit, then I certainly would not be inclined to agree to it."
Zhongli: My agreement with the Cryo Archon will be the last of my contracts as the Geo Archon — my "contract to end all contracts."
Zhongli: As for the bargaining chip that the Tsaritsa used to balance the scales...
Zhongli: Uncover that answer for yourself in your future journeys.
Paimon: Paimon:... can't... absorb so much information at once...
Paimon: "So, Zhongli:  what sort of contract did you sign with the Cryo Archon? Paimon:'s so curious!"
Zhongli: ...One of the clauses of our contract was not to divulge any of its contents.
Paimon: Ugh... You're so petty.
Paimon: Today's the day of the Rite of Parting.
Paimon: "Although the star of the show is fake, we've spent so much time trying to organize it. It would be a real shame not to go there now."
Big-Footed Dajiao,"...Well, since we're going through with this Rite of Parting... I guess it means that those rumors hit the nail on the head."
Wrench Wang,"So Rex Lapis is really... But they didn't catch the culprit, did that?"
Big-Footed Dajiao,"Ah, come on, do you think that the assassin could have been a normal person? You know what I think? I don't think any of the gossip on the streets you hear from those shady types is worth anything."
Big-Footed Dajiao,"There's only one real possibility in my mind. I've heard that the assassin was that Fatui fellow. Youngish, pretty high in rank — I think they called him Childe:."
Wrench Wang,"The Fatui? They certainly are very suspicious. Who knows what those greedy, crooked folks..."
Big-Footed Dajiao,"Shh! Lower your voice! If the Fatui catch you in their sights, Rex Lapis won't be around to protect you this time!"
Uncle Gao,"You know that god from the ocean couldn't have just shown up out of nowhere. I mean, it's been two thousand years since Rex Lapis subdued it."
Uncle Sun,"Yes, and to think that this happened right on the heels of the incident with Rex Lapis, too..."
Uncle Gao,"Say, do you think the person who assassinated our Lord and released that evil god might have been one and the same?"
Uncle Sun,"Now that you mention it, that's very possible. Yes... it's very possible indeed."
Uncle Sun,"I mean, it all fits together! That person must have colluded with the evil god to harm Rex Lapis. Ugh, that wicked black-hearted scoundrel..."
Uncle Sun,"Still, what sort of supernatural prowess must this person possess to be able to do such things? I have never heard of such a person in all my years."
Uncle Gao,"Ah, forget it. Guessing's no use to us. Look, the Millelith over there looks like he's about to make an announcement. Let's hear what the Ministry of Civil Affairs has to say first."
Fengyan,Hear ye all the Qixing's words
Fengyan,"Though a dragon soars ageless as the mountains, it too must return to dust. This is common knowledge."
Fengyan,"Gods and adepti live glorious lives, but both light and shadow have their season. So, too, must they face divinely-appointed trials."
Fengyan,"Rumors and hearsay abound on the streets that Rex Lapis was murdered. Now, let the truth be revealed."
Fengyan,"Having been thwarted in his trial, Rex Lapis' soul has recouped the celestial heights. He beseeches the people of Liyue to grieve not, and to not let their hearts be saddened."
Fengyan,Nor are they to believe street-borne rumors or indulge in baseless speculation.
Paimon: "Ah... Um, Paimon: needs a translation on what the Qixing's announcement said, (Traveler)."
Traveller: They said that Rex Lapis wasn't murdered.
Traveller: They said that Rex Lapis died because of a divine trial.
Paimon: ...So that's how they're spinning it...
Paimon: Something feels off. Why would they suddenly give up looking for the murderer? Not to mention how this excuse sounds like something they just made up on the spot.
Paimon: Could the Qixing already have known that Rex Lapis wasn't dead? But Zhongli: said that neither they nor adepti knew anything....
Paimon: Hmm... Did Zhongli: tell them in secret after his Gnosis changed hands?
Traveller: That's possible.
Traveller: I think you've hit the bull's-eye this time.
Paimon: "Exactly, right? Ooh, seems like the Rite of Parting has been going on for a while now. Let's go have a look."
Paimon: "Look, it'sNingguang:andKeqing:. Are they saying something? Are their speeches over?"
Ningguang: "....As said previously, Rex Lapis' soul returning to the heavens is the end of the contract, and it is also the end of an era."
Shitou,"3,700 years of contracts, burnt and reduced to ash..."
Ningguang: "We, the people of Liyue were indeed prosperous. But blinded by our prosperity, we forgot that time can be pitiless."
Ying'er,"The long, unending dream of our archon walking among us..."
Madame Ping,Mm...
Ningguang: "Now that we have awoken from our dream, we must learn to say farewell."
Ningguang: Will you stand with us as we reestablish our contracts — as we build a new age of prosperity?
Ganyu: "So concludes the words of her Eminence, the Tianquan."
Ganyu: Does Her Eminence the Yuheng have anything to add?
Paimon: Eh? Is she looking this way?
Keqing: Traveler.
Paimon: Yikes! She really is looking our way!
Crowd,Is that the traveler who they say defeated the ancient god?
Crowd,So young...
Keqing: "The Liyue Qixing always repay their debts. And as you have heard, our eyes see far and our reach is long."
Keqing: Name your price. You deserve that much.
Paimon: Whoa...
Traveller: …
Traveller: Well... could you help me put up some missing person posters...?
Shitou,"Ah, Rex Lapis... Rex Lapis..."
Shitou,"Hmm. Now that I think about it, if everyone's the same mind as me..."
Shitou,Perhaps mementos for Rex Lapis might be the best short-term business opportunity.
Ying'er,"Ha, and to think I'd put my best perfume on before coming here, thinking you'd like it..."
Ying'er,But it seems as if those perfumes really were meant to be offered to Rex Lapis.
Ying'er,"Well, that's fine. Suffer no rivals in love, they say, and that's three gone in one stroke. *chuckles*"
Madame Ping,As for the mortals and adepti of Liyue... what shape shall our relationship take from now on?
Keqing: "Heh. Why, you... Were you just trying to look cool earlier, or are you really that selfless?"
Keqing: "If you were looking for someone, you could have just told me that in private..."
Ningguang: "Roping you in was possibly the most masterful move we could have made. I believe that future generations will say so too, when our deeds come up for their review."
Ganyu: "The clean-up of the premises, managing the crowds as they exit, making an account of the Rite... There's much that remains to be done. I didn't miss anything, did I?"
Zhongli: Oh? Why are you hanging back here? Don't you want to get closer to the action?
Zhongli: "You went through a lot to organize this rite, and this is a rare opportunity to see your journey bear fruit with your own eyes. You should make the most of it."
Paimon: "Hey, Zhongli:!"
Paimon: "Look at this. Everyone in Liyue's caught up in their emotions, thinking they'll never see Rex Lapis again..."
Paimon: "...And here you are, looking all relaxed!"
Zhongli: "Hahaha. Why would I not feel more at ease after laying down the burden I have borne for 3,700 years?"
Zhongli: "Right, if the two of you can spare the time. I should treat you to a meal at theXinyue Kiosk."
Paimon: "Hah! That sounds like big talk, Zhongli:. Paimon: might have believed you if you were treating us to someThird-Round Knockout, but you'd have to pay out your nose just to stand inside Xinyue Kiosk. Are you sure you can afford it?"
Zhongli: Hmm...
Zhongli: "You're right, I do lack the Mora."
Traveller: "You've been this way this entire time, but..."
Paimon: But why would Morax lack Mora?
Traveller: But why would Morax lack Mora?
Zhongli: "As the Rex Lapis Morax, I can easily create Mora. But since I have chosen to walk this earth as the mortal Zhongli:  I should abide by the same rules that mortals do."
Zhongli: "When I was journeying with you, though I still had the Gnosis in hand, I knew that I must soon retire from my role as an archon. So I had to... rehearse a little, for my new life."
Paimon: "Oh, no wonder! Paimon: gets it now. You didn't look at the price tags when we were spending because you've never had to."
Paimon: "But since you weren't used to not being able to just make some Mora as and when you wanted to, you had to try becoming a parasite to society who lives off of other peoples' credit..."
Zhongli: "Well, we were only spending Fatui money. You don't have to say it like that..."
Zhongli: "In the city of commerce, we do not merely exchange money or goods. We also exchange knowledge, memories, and foresight, as well as positions, roles, and lives."
Zhongli: "The archon Morax could never experience life as the true mortal Zhongli: could, no matter how many times he descended to be with his people."
Zhongli: "Haha, I must thank you for that, (Traveler)."
Zhongli: "I will treasure the memories that I made as Zhongli:  traveling the streets of Liyue with you."
Traveller: It was a fine journey.
Zhongli: "That is true, but there is no journey that does not end. No meetings without partings."
Paimon: Mm... Paimon: thinks that we should make a move and continue our search for The Seven.
Zhongli: "I fear that continuing your journey may be difficult. The nation that neighbors Liyue by sea, Inazuma, is presently closed."
Traveller: """Closed""?"
Zhongli: Yes. The nation has been closed by order of its deity.
Traveller: Who's the god who rules Inazuma?
Zhongli: "The Electro Archon,Baal— and just as the people of Liyue preferred to call me Rex Lapis, she too goes by another name among locals in Inazuma."
Paimon: "Um, Paimon: thinks we've heard that one before. Uh.. Rai... Raiden?"
Zhongli: "That is the case. And since Raiden is also the Shogun of the Inazuma Bakufu, people call her the Raiden Shogun."
Traveller: The Inazuma Bakufu...
Traveller: The Shogun...
Paimon: "That said, thought people at the wharf were saying that the situation in Inazuma is very tense, Paimon: doesn't remember that always being the case. It wasn't that bad last year..."
Paimon: "Zhongli:  since you're Rex Lapis, shouldn't you know something about what's happening there? Just how did Inazuma become a closed nation?"
Zhongli: It's because ofVisions.
Paimon: Visions?
Zhongli: "When faced with circumstances beyond their control, humans often bemoan their lack of power."
Zhongli: "But if a person shows true strength of will at a desperate and fateful moment in their life, the gods will look upon them with favor."
Zhongli: That is what Visions are. Magical foci bestowed upon those who have been acknowledged by the gods.
Paimon: Uh-huh. That's how people in Teyvat see it.
Zhongli: "But starting from last year, the Raiden Shogun began promulgating the ""Vision Hunt Decree."""
Paimon: ...Vision Hunt Decree?
Zhongli: "Yes. It was an order to seize all Visions within Inazuma's borders, and to inlay them upon the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God."
Paimon: They want to seize Visions? But why? Aren't Visions blessings from the gods?
Zhongli: "I should think that in the Raiden Shogun's eyes, it is precisely because they are divine blessings, that they should be under the sole dominion of divinity."
Paimon: Whoa... That's harsh.
Zhongli: "The Anemo Archon is the God of Freedom, and the Geo Archon is the God of Contracts. For her part, the Raiden Shogun is the God of Eternity. It seems as though she has finally decided to eliminate any unstable elements that could pose a threat to her eternal realm."
Zhongli: "The fact that even I, the oldest of The Seven, have now ""passed away"" will only strengthen her resolve to pursue eternity."
Zhongli: "Knowing her, she must have again quoted that adage she is most fond of when proclaiming that decree to her people"
Zhongli: """Seven ideals for seven gods, and of these, Eternity is nearest unto Heaven."""
Traveller: Heaven...
Zhongli: "Alright, then. Was there anything else you wished to know?"
Traveller: "So, about the ""trial""..."
Zhongli: "Haha... Ah, that was a good one. Failing a divine trial? How they came up with that excuse, I will never know."
Zhongli: "That said, the reason why the Qixing were so eager to resolve the incident and stop pursuing the culprit was indeed because they received news in secret that Rex Lapis was not dead."
Zhongli: I hinted as much to the adepti as well.
Zhongli: "How did I accomplish that, you ask? Hmm... Have you ever heard of this particularly convenient adepti art known as ""gifting dreams and visions""?"
Traveller: What about Childe:...
Paimon: "Yeah, about that. Before the Qixing made their announcement, we listened to a lot of people talking on the way. Most of them put the blame of everything on Childe:."
Zhongli: "These are indeed false accusations, but it remains undeniably true that Childe: did send people to the Jade Chamber to prevent the adepti and the Qixing from defeating the ancient god."
Zhongli: "I've heard that Ningguang: is busy milking that for all it's worth on the foreign relations front at the moment, browbeating the envoys of the Fatui."
Zhongli: "Ah, those poor Snezhnayan diplomats. If it were not for Childe:'s exalted position as a Harbinger, I'm certain that they would have shifted all the blame to him and called for his dismissal by now."
Traveller: As for the Liyue Qixing...
Zhongli: """The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue?"""
Zhongli: Keqing: is absolutely right in saying this.
Zhongli: "Now, though I did laud Ningguang:'s desire for power, believing this to be a good thing, and thought as a matter of course that she must have been behind the Qixing's plan to take governing power over Liyue from the hands of the gods and adepti..."
Zhongli: Could the original person who brought up the idea of seizing power have been...? Hmm...
Traveller: "Now, about Mora..."
Paimon: "That's right! Zhongli:  now that you don't have your Gnosis, what's going to happen to all the Mora in Teyvat?"
Paimon: "Since Morax is ""dead,"" are they all just gonna disappear?"
Paimon: "Also, isn't the Golden House the only mint in the entire continent? Will it even continue to work?"
Zhongli: "The Mora present now will not vanish. But the Golden House will indeed have to cease operations for a lengthy period of time, since creating Mora requires the use of the Geo Archon's power."
Paimon: Argh! This is terrible. We're all about to run out of Mora! The world is coming to an end!
Zhongli: "Yes, this is indeed a major issue from a financial standpoint..."
Zhongli: Uh... Well. I suppose we'll just leave such troublesome matters to the Liyue Qixing to debate.
Paimon: Then... did you at least set some private funds aside for yourself?
Zhongli: "Oh, a private fund? Hmm, this does seem like a good, logical, common-sense idea."
Zhongli: "Ah, it's a shame..."
Paimon: What's a shame?
Zhongli: It's a shame that I didn't think of it at the time.
Traveller: There's nothing else...
Zhongli: "Well then, I suppose you'll have to find a way to get inside this closed nation. Have patience... I suspect that some serendipity must first come into play..."
Zhongli: Oh? I didn't think I would see you here.
Wanyan,Are these two your friends?
Zhongli: "Yes, we had the fortune of meeting (Traveler) not too long ago. They are quite a knowledgeable and talented pair, and a pleasure to be around."
Zhongli: "(Traveler), we were just discussing the history of Rex Lapis. Would you like to listen?"
Hanxue,"This good sir seems to not appreciate the almighty power of the Lord of Geo. As a professional archaeologist, I am to correct some of his erroneous views."
Traveller: "Actually, he is..."
Traveller: No-one knows better than him...
Hanxue,We are discussing the whereabouts of the first Mora.
Paimon: The "first Mora"?
Yixuan,"As everyone knows, the Lord of Geo taught the ancient people of Liyue the craft of smelting, creating goods that allowed them to develop trade with the early nations of that time."
Yixuan,Today Liyue holds the sole right to cast Mora in the entire continent of Teyvat. The world's very first Mora should have been cast by the hands of the Lord of Geo himself thousands of years ago.
Wanyan,According to my research — as well as my own hypothesis — I believe that this coin of unique historical significance has been passed down secretly through the years as a kind of token.
Wanyan,"For example, perhaps the Qixing who control Liyue use it in some kind of unknown ceremony they hold when they come to power..."
Hanxue,"No, no, no... My research indicates that the first Mora coin is not such a simple thing."
Hanxue,"Mora is a catalyst — this we all know. Even today, Mora is used in the mystic arts for its curious properties of weapon enhancement."
Hanxue,"The world's first Mora would no doubt possess the strongest power. My next historical treatise will boldly expound on the newest findings from my intense, decade-long research!"
Hanxue,"That is, that the Lord of Geo used this original Mora as a catalyst to enhance a dagger and a sword."
Paimon: "A dagger and a sword"?
Hanxue,"Well, buy the book when it comes out to read the full story. For now, I will only reveal this : the one who finds the dagger shall become supreme in Liyue, and the one who finds the sword may be crowned Liyue's sovereign—"
Zhongli: I... can't say I agree.
Hanxue,Hmm?
Zhongli: Let us not speak of the authenticity of the dagger and sword first... But Mora and money came about simply because they are a convenient measure of a contract's value.
Zhongli: Rex Lapis just meant for Mora to serve as a "catalyst" for people to exchange and trade.
Zhongli: "The world's first Mora is probably just an ordinary coin created by Rex Lapis. As for its fate? The same as all Mora, I suspect — it was simply spent somewhere."
Yixuan,"Hmm... I think that Mr. Hanxue's hypothesis seems reasonable. Mr. Zhongli:'s argument, on the other hand, lacks any evidence. How can you so easily dismiss the Lord of Geo's profound foresight?"
Zhongli: "No — no, I am not debating right or wrong. I am simply stating a fact."
Hanxue,Enough! Do you think you understand the Lord of Geo more than me?
Traveller: "Actually, he is..."
Traveller: No-one knows better than him...
Zhongli: "I know but little about history and I wouldn't dare to brag. But discussion is meaningless if everyone has the same opinions, no?"
Yixuan,"Well then, answer me this :  Long ago, when Liyue Harbor was being constructed, the Lord of Geo taught the people how to build houses. The model home he used to teach them was completely cast from Mora, correct? Long ago, when Liyue Harbor was being constructed, the Lord of Geo taught the people how to build houses. The model home he used to teach them was completely cast from Mora, correct?"
Zhongli: "That is correct, indeed."
Hanxue,"Okay then, tell me :  Why would the Lord of Geo do something so extravagant if not because of the mystical power that Mora contains?"
Zhongli: "There's a simple explanation, really. To the God of Wealth and Commerce, what material is easier to get than Mora?"
Hanxue,Oh... Huh...
Traveller: It's like you're telling someone else's tale.
Zhongli: "Hehe, I mean... I am talking about Rex Lapis."
Wanyan,...
Wanyan,"Excuse me, sir! Uh... I have some questions about archaeology. Can we find somewhere quiet to chat? I mean, if it's okay with you."
Zhongli: "Oh, it's no problem at all. But may my friend accompany us? Perhaps they could be of some help."
Traveller: "Who, me?"
Traveller: I'm just here for a good story.
Wanyan,"Of course, They can come if that's what pleases you, sir. Let's go."
Hanxue,The Lord of Geo sure is something. Barely been gone and already his name is being slandered.
Yixuan,"Although we are in the age of humankind, surely we must still show a measure of respect for the gods of the past..."
Wanyan,What I'm about to say is a bit disrespectful of the Lord of Geo and would draw a lot of angry looks... so it's best to discuss this somewhere quiet.
Wanyan,"Your argument just now exhibited acuteness of speech and thought. Most importantly, you don't fall for the boasting and acting of the others. You remain objective."
Wanyan,"So I have a question for you, perhaps you will answer differently from other scholars... Do you think that all the gods that the Geo Archon killed were evil?"
Zhongli: "...Let's not analyze it in terms of good versus evil. Rex Lapis placed great importance on the integrity of contracts, so any gods he killed certainly must have broken some kind of contract."
Paimon: "Right, the Lord of Geo wouldn't kill the innocent."
Wanyan,"But when I was doing some research, I learned about the legend of the God of Salt."
Wanyan,"The God of Salt,Havria, was a very kind god, but she encountered Morax one day in battle..."
Wanyan,Morax used a rather underhanded trick to... assassinate her.
Paimon: What!? No way!
Zhongli: This... this bit of history is a long story. But you may not like the truth when you hear it.
Wanyan,"Don't worry, please tell me what you know! This event... I have already searched for answers for a long time."
Traveller: "You look a bit embarrassed, Zhongli:."
Zhongli: "No, It's just... Where should I begin?"
Traveller: Is the story that complicated?
Zhongli: Quite so. I don't know where to begin.
Kliment,"Hey, over here! Mr. Zhongli:  I've been looking for you! So you were over here all this time."
Traveller: The Fatui?
Traveller: What do you want!? Spit it out!
Paimon: Put down your weapon and stay back! Otherwise... Paimon:'s reporting you to the Millelith!
Kliment,"First of all, I'm not holding a weapon!"
Kliment,"Ugh... There's no need to overreact, now. I'm simply an archaeological research from Snezhnaya, I'm not here for trouble."
Paimon: The Fatui say that every time.
Kliment,"But this time, I registered with the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs. I could show you official documentation if you want to see it."
Kliment,"I will be conducting an archaeological survey here, the results of which will all be shared with the Ministry."
Kliment,I heard that Wangsheng Funeral Parlor had a consultant named Zhongli: with immense knowledge of ancient history and archaeology. So I paid Wangsheng Funeral Parlor a handsome amount to hire Zhongli: as my own consultant while I'm in town.
Zhongli: "So you mean to say that this is work for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, yes?"
Traveller: What should we do?
Traveller: I think it's best to be cautious.
Zhongli: "Well since it's work, I don't have a choice. A consultant of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor must respect their duty."
Kliment,"Of course, you would be such a reasonable man! Well then, let's head out now, shall we?"
Wanyan,"Wait, if you are studying archaeology, can I go too? I am also a scholar in this field so I can help."
Zhongli: "That will give us a chance to continue the topic we were just discussing. Oh, and you should tag along too, (Traveler)."
Traveller: Why?
Traveller: I don't really know anything about archaeology.
Zhongli: This experience may be of help to you on your future adventures.
Zhongli: "It is a story from before the rise of The Seven... Although the God of Salt has already perished, it will still be a meaningful experience for your journey."
Kliment,"This is— Wait, this is an archaeological expedition, not a tour group! That's too many people."
Zhongli: But this friend of mine has a treasure-finding talent surpassed by no-one. It will surely be of great help to us.
Kliment,Oh? What talent?
Zhongli: "If my friend espies a treasure chest, they will absolutely find a way to open it."
Paimon: "Hey, Paimon:'s good at that, too!"
Kliment,Well... That is quite enticing. Alright then.
Kliment,"Well, let's go. There's no time to waste. When theOverlord of the Vortexwas crushed by the Jade Chamber recently, perhaps something of interest was washed ashore..."
Kliment,"An ancient artifact would be good, traces of ancient activity would be great, but a piece of the god's limb would be even better... Who knows what surprises we many find...?"
Kliment,This place looks so ordinary... Can we really find anything valuable here?
Paimon:,Huh? Paimon: thinks it looks really grand!
Kliment,"I don't mean the scenery, but rather that there should be something out of the ordinary. A big battle did just occur and all... And I don't even know where to begin looking here."
Zhongli: Guyun Stone Forest is actually the perfect place to be if you wish to learn about the Archons or the history of the Archon War.
Zhongli: "Legend has it that Rex Lapis threw spears made of large rock into the sea here, piercing and crushing the Overlord of the Vortex."
Zhongli: "After many years of wind erosion, those stone spears have turned into the unique rock formations we see now."
Paimon:,Th—These mountains were the Lord of Geo's weapons?
Zhongli: "What we see now is just the part of them that remains. The stone spears hurled by Rex Lapis all those years ago were much greater, both in number and in size."
Zhongli: "But due to the different angles they landed at, their large centers of mass, erosion by seawater, and years of gravity, many of them have been completely swallowed by the sea."
Zhongli: "So, besides wind erosion, the initial collapsing of the stone spears also played a big part in the formation of Guyun Stone Forest."
Kliment,Well... A god able to fight one so powerful that Rex Lapis was certainly very strong in its own right.
Zhongli: "Indeed, this is where the value lies in research at Guyun Stone Forest."
Zhongli: "Most of the objects from that time were lost to the sea, but the gigantic waves created by the Overlord of the Vortex have given those sunken objects a chance to see the light of day again."
Kliment,"So you're saying that if we look carefully, we'll be able to get very, very rich—"
Kliment,"Uh, I mean — rich with archaeological knowledge and historical value, yes? That's all I seek in life."
Kliment,"Well, since we brought so many people, I think it would be best to split up and look."
Zhongli: "Okay then, I will go with my friend here. Although I have a smattering of knowledge in various disciplines, when it comes to archaeology, I can't compete with the expert here."
Wanyan,Huh? M—Me?
Kliment,What's the matter? This is your profession. Why are you so surprised?
Wanyan,"I get it... I'll escort him, then."
Zhongli: "Okay. If we find anything valuable or rare, let's meet on the shore opposite from here."
Zhongli: The ancient god probably left behind lots of elemental marks. Following them should make our search much easier.
Paimon:,"Well, go ahead then, (Traveler). Use your Elemental Sight to look for any marks."
Paimon: Why are there enemies here?
Zhongli: "Guyun Stone Forest is a place where a god was defeated, and its remnants still affect the area to this day."
Paimon:,They're... gathering together here. But why?
Zhongli: See that object in the center? Perhaps it emits the remnant strength of that god. That would certainly attract them.
Zhongli: "But, the Hydro Mimic monsters... Hmmm. I have a contract, and must put my personal feelings aside. Go ahead, defeat them and recover the relic."
Zhongli: It's just a stone slab... but its design is quite unique.
Zhongli: This should be enough to garner some information. Let's head back.
Kliment,"...You call yourself a scholar of archaeology? You can't even recognize this or that, what are you good for?"
Wanyan,We all have our areas of expertise! I already tried very hard to explain!
Paimon:,Stop arguing! What in the world happened?
Kliment,"This girl just kept bragging about how she's an archeologist, but she doesn't even know anything about the surrounding ruins! I even know more than her!"
Kliment,"She left me to rely solely on my guessing — I mean, experience — to find anything valuable to take back. Ugh, what a waste of time!"
Wanyan,"I—I've just been researching the God of Salt, so I'm not familiar with the sea relics. Is that so strange!?"
Traveller: "(Hmm, it is a bit strange...)"
Traveller: (One shouldn't lack general knowledge in their field...)
Wanyan,And you! You kept asking about how much Mora everything is worth! Can the value of relics only be measured in Mora!?
Kliment,"Uh... I mean, isn't measuring their value in Mora the easiest way? This also matches the traditions of Liyue, does it not?"
Zhongli: "Now, now, calm down, no need to make a fuss. We were able to bring back some intriguing objects. Let's have a look."
Zhongli: Oh...
Zhongli: "What a shame. *sigh* These objects were indeed washed ashore by the Overlord of Vortex, but they have nothing to do with the god besides being in the vicinity at the time."
Zhongli: "This stone slab we found, however, has a mysterious pattern and faint aura of divine power. Perhaps it will be useful for research purposes."
Kliment,"Quick, give it to me!"
Kliment,"Hehe, at least we didn't come for nothing. The power of gods, yes! This is good..."
Kliment,"Oh, but these other objects are certainly worth a little something right? It should be enough to cover the cost of hiring you — it's all mine!"
Paimon:,Sooo... it's only valuable for research if there are remnants of divine power on it?
Wanyan,Not at all. My quest to uncover the history of the God of Salt is because history can tell us about culture and beliefs...
Wanyan,But YOU... You're just trying to use archaeology to get rich!
Kliment,"Nonsense! I'm a professional archaeology researcher from Snezhnaya, I swear. If I'm lying, may the Lord of Geo strike me down!"
Traveller: "(No, you're trying to get rich off archaeology... )"
Traveller: "(No, you're trying to collect the strength of the gods...)"
Zhongli: "Oh, by the way. You probably don't want to sell that teacup."
Kliment,"Oh, why's that?"
Zhongli: "That's not an ancient teacup. It's part ofNingguang:'s collection, it must have fallen here along with theJade Chamber. So unless you want to mess with the Qixing..."
Kliment,"Agh, I see... What a shame. It was of such high quality, too."
Wanyan,See!? You do want to sell these objects!
Kliment,S—So what! Why can't I pursue wealth both intellectual and material? Don't be so simple-minded!
Kliment,"Alright then! No need to stay here any longer. Hm. I'm rather quite intrigued by the God of Salt too, actually. Let's go toSal Terraenext."
Wanyan,Argh! You're simply a money-grubber!
Kliment,And what are you then? All you think about is digging up valuable relics every day!
Paimon:,They're still arguing. Let's not bother them...
Kliment,I heard that Sal Terrae was once the home of the God of Salt's people. Therefore... *chuckles* There are sure to be loads of valuable relics nearby.
Zhongli: "According to legend, the people of the God of Salt, Havria, enjoyed prosperous lives under her protection."
Zhongli: "But this legend has been around for ages. With the countless scrap collectors and Treasure Hoarders in the area, there probably aren't many valuable things left here."
Kliment,"Gah, that's just great... If I knew it was picked this clean before, I wouldn't have come."
Wanyan,"About that, I know there's a ruin deep in this cave here. It's related to the God of Salt, which is actually how the area originally got its name of Sal Terrae."
Wanyan,"However, the ruin entrance has been sealed by a mysterious power. Nobody has been able to break the seal."
Wanyan,"I found a mechanism that seemed to be related to the seal. But when I undid the mechanism, the seal wasn't affected at all."
Wanyan,"So at the moment, the seal's origin and how to break it are very important topics in my research on the God of Salt"
Traveller: Is it related to the God of Salt's people?
Traveller: Is it related to Rex Lapis?
Wanyan,"I don't know, there's no concrete evidence. But I'm pretty sure the seal is meant to hide some kind of long-forgotten truth."
Wanyan,"The God of Salt was a benevolent god adored by the people, not to mention powerful. She wouldn't have any kind of shameful secrets to hide."
Wanyan,"So... The one who wants to hide some truth is very possibly her killer, Morax."
Paimon: "This doesn't sound like something the Lord of Geo would do, though..."
Kliment,"Who cares about all that? It sounds like countless treasures of the God of Salt lie within this ruin, just waiting for someone to find them, right!?"
Wanyan,"You weren't listening at all, were you? Argh... Even if there's a mountain of treasures inside, nobody can get in if the seal isn't broken."
Kliment,"Ah, but we have the illustrious Mr. Zhongli: with us! He looks like he knows just about everything — a little seal shouldn't be any trouble for him."
Wanyan,This seal seems to be quite ancient. Even Mr. Zhongli: may not know all of its secrets...
Zhongli: I may know something about it.
Wanyan,Wh—Whaaat!?
Zhongli: "Over the years, I've heard various rumors with bits of knowledge about seals. Although their references seem rather disorderly, they do in fact contain the secret to breaking seals."
Zhongli: Let's go take a look at the mechanism Miss Wanyan just mentioned.
Wanyan,"Okay, since Mr. Zhongli: says so... Follow me, then."
Wanyan,"Here it is. There's some debris scattered here that, when put together, look like they definitely had something to do with the God of Salt."
Wanyan,"According to the inscription on the side, if one looks from a certain angle, the secret to the mechanism will be revealed."
Wanyan,"See that? Although we activated the mechanism, nothing happened to the seal..."
Zhongli: That's because there's actually another mechanism that must be activated.
Wanyan,A—Another?
Zhongli: Let me lead the way from here.
Wanyan,"This place seems familiar... Ah, I remember! I think there's some elemental monuments here — so you're saying they're related to all this?"
Wanyan,"When I investigated this seal last time, I had someone with a Vision accompany me."
Wanyan,"But when we lit up all the elemental monuments, nothing happened..."
Zhongli: "That's because you don't just need to activate them at the same time, but in a certain order as well. Otherwise, the seal will not be broken."
Zhongli: The secret to this puzzle is hidden in the legends about the Archon War.
Zhongli: """Tianhengin thesouth,Yaoguangin theeast,Jueyunin thewest,Qingcein thenorth— All desolate and devoid of life. Liyue is vast, yet even one haven is hard to find."""
Kliment,To the north... to the east... Do the people of Liyue always talk in riddles?
Wanyan,I—I think I've heard this saying before!
Zhongli: "Certainly you have, and the contents of this saying are also related to the God of Salt."
Zhongli: "To provide a haven for her people, whose lives had been ravaged by the Archon War, this benevolent god searched all across Liyue."
Zhongli: "At that time, with the chaotic fires of war engulfing the land, even one sliver of peace was a luxury."
Zhongli: "And that haven she eventually found is right here. Today, it is known as Sal Terrae."
Wanyan,"How sad then... In the end, this peaceful place was destroyed by Morax."
Kliment,"Okay, enough with these ancient stories. Now that we have the clue, hurry up and break the seal! Whatever happened doesn't matter as long as we can get inside that ruin!"
Zhongli: "Now think (Traveler),""Tianheng in the south, Yaoguang in the east, Jueyun in the west, Qingce in the north."""
Zhongli: "With this clue, you should be able to solve the puzzle."
Zhongli: "Tianheng in thesouth, Yaoguang in theeast, Jueyun in thewest, Qingce in thenorth."
Zhongli: The directions are the clue. Give it another try.
Wanyan,Look! The seal really was broken! Mr. Zhongli: is indeed quite remarkable!
Zhongli: "It was nothing, really."
Zhongli: "Now, it's time that people learn the hidden truth lost in time."
Zhongli: "Before entering the ruin, I have a proposal that will help us prevent the kind of senseless arguing between you two that we saw at Guyun Stone Forest."
Wanyan,"Okay, what is it?"
Zhongli: "I propose you two agree upon a contract, stipulating that we alternate who gets claim to each treasure we encounter, with only one object permitted per claim."
Zhongli: "To show my sincerity, I won't be taking any treasure — this will just be between you all."
Traveller: I won't take any either.
Paimon: Heyyy! Don't pass an opportunity like this up so easily!
Kliment,"I don't agree! I mean... you want me to split the treasure with this amateur archaeologist? No, absolutely not!"
Wanyan,"I don't agree either! Hmph, he will only defile the precious relics left behind by the God of Salt! I—I can't accept this."
Zhongli: "Well then... If the contract is not agreed upon, I will no longer serve as your consultant on this expedition."
Zhongli: "You will have to rely on your own experience to find whatever treasures are hidden in this ruin, as well as traps."
Kliment,Y—You have the audacity to demand this... Okay then. Even half of the treasure in the long-sealed ruin of the God of Salt should be enough to make a fortune.
Wanyan,"If you want me to agree upon this contract, so be it... I just have one request, Mr. Zhongli:."
Wanyan,"If we discover the truth behind the God of Salt, you must judge it fairly, even if the truth harms Morax's image."
Zhongli: I can accept this arrangement.
Zhongli: "Well then, let's go."
Wanyan,A—Are these... statues?
Zhongli: No. These are people.
Kliment,Urgh...
Zhongli: They were probably followers of the God of Salt.
Kliment,How did they become this way...?
Wanyan,What in the world is hidden deep in this ruin...?
Wanyan,Look at this. It's filled halfway with salt.
Kliment,Just looks like a fancy salt holder. Seems like the God of Salt was a god lacking in treasures.
Zhongli: "According to my knowledge, it's no ordinary vessel. Although it is only half-full, it is also forever half-full — that is to say, it is bottomless."
Kliment,"What!? You're saying that even if I pour the salt out, the amount inside won't change!?"
Zhongli: Exactly.
Wanyan,Able to produce endless salt... The God of Salt is powerful indeed!
Kliment,"Finally, after all that effort, I've found precious treasure! I claim this as mine!"
Kliment,"I just need to pour the endless salt into a thousand, or ten-thousand bags... I can sell it and make a fortune!"
Wanyan,Hey! How can you use a relic of the God of Salt for such a shallow pursuit!?
Zhongli: "If Mr. Kliment wants this salt chalice, then the next object we find will belong to Miss Wanyan, according to the contract agreed upon."
Kliment,"Of course, as we agreed. Hehe, but how can anything be worth more than this rare find?"
Wanyan,"Since we have a contract, it's no use for me to fight with him..."
Zhongli: "Then let's move on, shall we?"
Kliment,"Ha, just a simple ruler. Doesn't look to be worth anything."
Wanyan,"This... If I remember correctly, this is some kind of measuring tool."
Zhongli: Indeed. But the God of Salt imbued it with another power.
Zhongli: "When you stick this ruler in the ground, the surrounding area will become covered in salt, much like a rising tide covers the earth."
Zhongli: "The deeper it is stuck in the ground, the more salt will appear. It is essentially a ""bumper harvest"" of salt."
Kliment,Th—That's even better than the salt chalice!
Zhongli: "Well then, according to our contract, the salt ruler goes to Miss Wanyan."
Kliment,No! Unacceptable! I paid for and organized this entire expedition. Why should I get the short end of the stick!
Kliment,And this girl has been useless. Why should she get anything!?
Paimon: "Oh boy, here we go again..."
Traveller: *sigh*
Traveller: While we're on the topic of "useless" people...
Zhongli: "So you are saying, you want to break the contract?"
Kliment,"So what if I break it? Now that I've seen how the mechanisms in this ruin work, I no longer need you."
Kliment,Let's not forget who hired who here. Why should I let you make the rules?
Zhongli: Because you agreed to a contract.
Zhongli: Rex Lapis once said :  "Ones who break their contracts shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock."
Kliment,"That is one of your Liyue gods. I am from Snezhnaya, I—"
Zhongli: —Will "suffer the Wrath of the Rock" — you may find it rather unpleasant.
Zhongli: I shall confiscate your treasure as well.
Zhongli: You are not worthy to continue any further into the ruin. Leave this place.
Kliment,Darn you... Just you wait!
Paimon: Some "archaeological survey..." He could only pretend for so long.
Traveller: At least we had our guard up.
Paimon: "Yeah, good thing Paimon: can smell a liar from a mile away."
Traveller: "I hope you never become as greedy as him, Paimon:."
Paimon: "Hey! Paimon: likes Mora, but Paimon: doesn't do bad things!"
Zhongli: "Kliment's wrongdoing stemmed from greed, yes. But besides greed, there are many other things that may tempt us to break contracts."
Zhongli: "When people see the object of their dreams, how many are really able to control their desire and follow the contract...?"
Zhongli: I think we should be honest with each other now.
Paimon: Huh? Be honest about what?
Zhongli: "That in truth, not a single member of this ""archaeological expedition"" came here for archaeology."
Wanyan,Wh—Why do you say that?
Zhongli: "Miss, you lack even the most basic archaeological knowledge and can recognize naught but a few simple relics. However, you are an expert when it comes to anything regarding the God of Salt."
Zhongli: You aren't interested in archaeology or relics — what you're really interested in is the God of Salt.
Zhongli: I believe those legends about the God of Salt that you mentioned on thePearl Galleyare passed down between generations atYinyuan Hall...
Wanyan,"Okay, that's enough!"
Wanyan,"...Sir, you are indeed a man of great knowledge and talents. I seem to have been right to seek you out, once I plucked up my courage."
Wanyan,You're right. I'm not a scholar of archaeology. I come from one of theEight Tradesunder the jurisdiction of the Qixing — Yinyuan Hall of the salt industry.
Wanyan,"Our ancestors were those protected by the God of Salt all those years, when the Archon War engulfed the land in chaos."
Traveller: "Come to think of it, I've never heard you say ""Rex Lapis""..."
Traveller: "Hmm, I've never heard you say ""Lord of Geo""..."
Paimon: "Oh right. Now that you mention it, the people of Liyue very seldom use the name ""Morax""..."
Wanyan,"During the war, Morax assassinated our god out of envy for her power! He left us alone and lost in the world."
Wanyan,"We... We hate him! But this is Morax's Liyue, after all, and its history is written as he wishes..."
Wanyan,"So, I seek proof of Morax's guilt! He has blood on his hands, and cruelty in his heart!"
Zhongli: ...
Wanyan,"We agreed to a contract that we will face the truth head-on, didn't we Mr. Zhongli:!? You must judge this history fairly!"
Zhongli: "Naturally, of course. But I must add, Liyue is no longer Morax's Liyue."
Zhongli: Come with me. All the answers you seek lie ahead.
Wanyan,This is... a sword?
Wanyan,"Aha! It's a broken sword, this is proof! This proves that the God of Salt had to fight back, fight back against the evil Morax! But sadly, she was defeated..."
Wanyan,The power of this sword surely is much greater than that of the salt chalice and salt ruler!
Wanyan,"If we can repair this sword, then we can show the world the mighty power of the God of Salt..."
Paimon: Hmm... It does look like something left behind after being defeated in battle.
Zhongli: "Two pieces of a broken sword. From an archaeological perspective, these are two separate relics. According to the contract, you can only claim one."
Wanyan,"Wh—Why? We were alternating claims to treasure, true, but Kliment is no longer here..."
Zhongli: "Yes, but the ""only one object per claim"" clause still holds true. You cannot take two relics at the same time."
Wanyan,Th—This logic...
Paimon: "Erm... Zhongli:  she seems like a good person, and no-one is fighting over treasure. How about you let this one slide, huh?"
Zhongli: "When there's a contract, nothing can be allowed to ""slide."" If the contract is not followed, then it is broken."
Wanyan,"No! If I only take one half, then it can't be repaired, and the power of the God of Salt cannot be restored..."
Wanyan,"No matter what, I must be faithful to her..."
Wanyan,"Even if it breaks the contract, I don't care."
Zhongli: "So you are already decided? Hmm... Then, there is a price to pay for breaking the contract."
Paimon: Zhongli:!
Zhongli: "That is to say, you consign yourself to ""suffer the Wrath of the Rock."""
Wanyan,That... That's okay. The God of Salt gave up her life to protect her people. My sacrifice is nothing compared to that.
Wanyan,Punish me however you want. Just let me take this proof of my faith!
Paimon: "No, you can't hit her!"
Zhongli: "Perhaps that punishment would be easier for her, but..."
Zhongli: "As punishment, I will tell you the truth."
Wanyan,Huh?
Wanyan,The truth? You mean the truth is my punishment?
Zhongli: Yes. The truth that I am about to tell you shall be your price to pay for breaking the contract.
Zhongli: "I'm afraid to say that the God of Salt, Havria, was not the powerful god you imagine her to be."
Zhongli: "Rather, she was a small and weak god who yielded to all other gods. When it came to war, she lost... never able to win a seat among The Seven."
Wanyan,Wh—What...!?
Zhongli: "During the Archon War, the gods of this world used all their strength and cunning to vie for control of Teyvat."
Zhongli: "But Havria instead chose to flee. She thought that by giving up before a fight could start, she could save herself and her people from the war."
Zhongli: "However, during such a long war, there is no end to the advances of aggressors."
Zhongli: "After making countless concessions, Havria had lost all of her lands until only one small haven remained."
Wanyan,No... no... it can't be so...
Zhongli: "In her last days, she had not even a single blade to defend her people with."
Wanyan,"""Not even a single blade?"" Then, this sword..."
Zhongli: This sword is not a relic belonging to the God of Salt... but is instead the murder weapon used to kill her.
Wanyan,Murder weapon?
Wanyan,"No! That's not true, that can't be true! You are trying to test my faith in the God of Salt!"
Zhongli: "As I said before, I only state the facts."
Wanyan,"Preposterous! Y—You are a follower of Morax, don't try to trick me!"
Paimon: Hey! Heyyy! Come back!
Traveller: That was too much for her to take.
Zhongli: "It is a punishment, after all. I did not want to tell her such cruel facts, but the contract was broken..."
Traveller: "What you said really is true, right?"
Zhongli: "Indeed. Otherwise, why would I use the truth as punishment? I did not want to tell her such cruel facts, but the contract was broken..."
Zhongli: "Let's follow her deeper into the ruin. There, I fear, we will find something that will leave her no choice but to face the truth."
Paimon: Are these statue thingies... running?
Paimon: What will we find ahead...?
Zhongli: Salt. And betrayal.
Wanyan,...What are all these?
Wanyan,What did they see... What did they do?
Wanyan,What... What happened?
Zhongli: "Since you do not trust me, let us continue onward."
Zhongli: That which lies beyond this door will show you all that happened back then.
Zhongli: "This is the scene of the crime. Havria's body dissipated, leaving nothing but these traces of salt. Her dying moments have since been frozen in time to this very day."
Wanyan,...
Zhongli: "The story continues that some among her people realized at last that this gentle, kind but weak god could never protect anyone in wartime."
Zhongli: "The Archon War was cruel in the extreme. Instead of consigning her to the agony of defeat, they thought, perhaps it would be better to give her a quick release."
Paimon: But what about these statue thingies?
Zhongli: "No matter how weak the god, the power that flows forth when they are slain is beyond the strength of mortal coils to bear."
Zhongli: Those who could not flee were thus transformed.
Zhongli: "Those of her people who were untouched by this disaster left for Liyue, where they sought refuge with Rex Lapis."
Zhongli: Their descendants feared Havria's remnants and lived in terror that she had laid upon them an eternal curse...
Zhongli: "So they risked their lives to come here to break the sword, and offer up obeisances in hopes that her anger might be appeased."
Zhongli: But they need not have done so. For how could a god who had never once resisted — even till the end — nurse hatred for her people in her heart?
Wanyan,"I—I... Even if this is so, I can't..."
Wanyan,This must be a lie... a false history... all of it!
Wanyan,Don't you dare try to... shake my faith!
Paimon: "Yikes, Zhongli: didn't show any mercy this time, either..."
Zhongli: This is the price she must pay... Yet I would not call it a bad thing.
Zhongli: "Judging by how she appeared, I fear that she will struggle for a time. But even if she may not escape that struggle immediately, simply recognizing the truth is good enough for now."
Traveller: You seem all too familiar with what happened to the God of Salt.
Zhongli: "Indeed. In ages past, Havria's story served as a warning to me as well."
Traveller: "You didn't just hear rumors about the way to break the seal, did you?"
Zhongli: "No, indeed. How sharp of you — yet this is not a matter of wisdom. Only age."
Zhongli: Faith in a god who has already passed will do you no good.
Zhongli: "So it is for Havria, and so it is for Morax also."
Traveller: The people of Liyue will understand that one day.
Zhongli: "Alright, then. Now, would you like to accompany me in taking a trip to Guyun Stone Forest?"
Paimon: "Huh? What do you want to do, Zhongli:?"
Zhongli: *sigh*...
Zhongli: "Treading old ground, telling old stories..."
Zhongli: ...One cannot help but be reminded of old acquaintances.
Zhongli: "Now, I mentioned before that many gods of old have been sealed beneath the Guyun Stone Forest."
Zhongli: "The adepti have presently handed Liyue over to mortals, and Havria's time was even further in the past. The salt chalice and salt ruler that she left behind should not return to Liyue."
Zhongli: "To leave them here is to let them slumber, and it is also a homecoming..."
Traveller: "So, what would you like us to do?"
Zhongli: I ended an era with my own two hands. I have always wondered how I should... remember that which I ended.
Zhongli: "History records, but history may be changed. This incident proved that. Time is a mighty force, and histories twist in its flow..."
Zhongli: I need to find a better way of recording history in order to engrave its truth.
Zhongli: "Stone carvings were one such ancient method. But unchanging stone, immovable earth, even one such as myself... Someday, we may all disappear."
Paimon: Zhongli:...
Zhongli: "Therefore, I thought of you, Traveler."
Zhongli: "You are one who crosses the celestial atlas, and who passes through countless worlds. If our history is engraved in your memory, it will one day accompany you into another world."
Zhongli: "As long as a Traveler like you is able to record what happened, then a backup of sorts will exist for times and tides of Teyvat."
Traveller: So that's why you wanted us to come with you.
Paimon: Sounds like tough work.
Traveller: So you didn't just bring me along to find treasure?
Zhongli: "Hahaha... Well, may you find treasure among the stars even after you have left Teyvat."
Zhongli: "Now, I am the God of Wealth, so I would think that my words have some weight here."
Zhongli: "Now then, it is time that we consigned both the salt chalice and salt ruler to the sea."
Paimon: Huh? Why do we need to throw them into the sea?
Zhongli: As I said before... This is the place to which the remnants of many bygone gods are consigned.
Zhongli: "This includes Osial, Overlord of the Vortex, who the Jade Chamber most recently returned to this ocean prison..."
Zhongli: "Thousands of years ago,the adepti and I fought against the turmoil that plagued every corner of this land."
Zhongli: "Guyun Stone Forest, where I sealed many gods with my spears..."
Zhongli: "After so long, naught but folktales remain."
Zhongli: Osial... you and I were foes...
Zhongli: But our ancient grudge is but a bygone memory now.
Zhongli: May that which Havria has left behind be yours to subsume.
Zhongli: Thus another spark of divinity departs from Liyue.
Zhongli: My legacy shall now be left for those who come after to debate.
Zhongli: I will remain here for a while. I fear that moments of reminiscence like this can only grow fewer.
Traveller: I feel a bit bad for the God of Salt...
Zhongli: We did not measure right and wrong during the days of the Archon War in the same manner as we do today.
Zhongli: "Of course, as I am now... I only wish that she could have lived in a gentler time."
Traveller: Won't these relics cause Osial to grow in power?
Zhongli: "Though the salt chalice and salt ruler do have power in their own right, they are nothing before Osial."
Zhongli: "If a day comes when he should recover his strength and return... Ha, I believe that even so, he will be defeated once more."
Traveller: What will you do now?
Zhongli: "That is a good question. In the past, I might have given you a most specific answer."
Zhongli: "But now... Yes, I suppose I will continue in my role as a consultant at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor."
Zhongli: "But if this journey was to your liking, why don't you come along the next time I am seeking to preserve memories of Liyue's past?"
Paimon: "Hi Katheryne, it's us! Any new commissions?"
Katheryne,"As a matter of fact, there's one that looks perfect for you two."
Katheryne,Uncle Dai is one of the foremen atHuishan Hallover in Liyue Harbor. He's hoping the Adventurers' Guild can spare some manpower.
Paimon: What is it we have to do exactly?
Katheryne,I believe you'll be looking for workers.
Paimon: "Ooh, looking for people? Awesome, we're good at that!"
Katheryne,I have no reason to doubt your abilities.
Katheryne,"I'm sure the details can be worked out face to face. If you're willing to accept this commission, head over to the dock and talk to Uncle Dai."
Paimon: Hey! Are you Uncle Dai?
Uncle Dai,I am indeed.
Uncle Dai,"Ahh, now then, you must be the adventurers assigned by the Guild."
Paimon: Huh? How could you tell!?
Uncle Dai,"By the clothes on your back and the look on your face. Experienced adventurers at that, I'll wager."
Paimon: Right again! You're pretty perceptive!
Uncle Dai,"Hahaha. In this trade, you need a sharp eye for people, not just rocks. Uncle Dai can see what you're made of from a long way off."
Uncle Dai,"Alright, my assistant should be arriving soon so let's just wait here a moment."
Paimon: "Whoa whoa, that's why we're here! Now there's someone else taking a cut?"
Uncle Dai,"Well, to tell you the truth, this is a very difficult matter. Too much for adventurers alone to handle, I fear..."
Paimon: Hmph! So there is someone else!
Paimon: Do you think we're not up to the job?
Traveller: "Steady, Paimon:..."
Traveller: "Paimon:  you're getting competitive again..."
Uncle Dai,"It just occurred to me that you don't have all the facts. The incident in question happened in a mine, and it's a little out of the ordinary, to say the least. Mines are dangerous places, as I'm sure you're aware. As such, I've enlisted an industry expert to cover all contingencies."
Uncle Dai,"Last time I checked, adventurers weren't experts in ore appraisal or geological analysis. With a professional by your side, everything should run smoothly."
Uncle Dai,"Besides, this guy is the best in his field. No matter the rock, he'll tell you its value to the nearest Mora at a glance."
Uncle Dai,I'd go as far to say that there's not a soul in Teyvat that knows rocks better than him. I'd be a fool to not enlist an expert of his caliber!
Paimon: You're a fool if you think you found Teyvat's number one rock expert!
Uncle Dai,Oh? And why might that be?
Paimon: Because Teyvat's number one rock expert happens to be a friend of ours...
Traveller: You must be talking about...
Traveller: "(Perfect, I was planning to ask him a few questions.)"
Paimon: "Haha~ Didn't expect that, did you! Wait here, we'll go fetch him."
Paimon: Paimon: bets Zhongli: is listening to the Storyteller. Let's head over!
Uncle Dai,Your rock expert... what does he look like?
Iron Tongue Tian,"In our last tale, Rex Lapis..."
Paimon: Zhongli:! There you are!
Zhongli: Oh!
Zhongli: Here for a few tales? I didn't know you two were connoisseurs.
Paimon: "Oh, no no! We're here for you! Um... do you have time?"
Zhongli: Ah... something I'm rarely short of.
Traveller: We've accepted a commission...
Traveller: We have a special task...
Paimon: We need someone who understands geology and ore.
Zhongli: Hmm... someone who understands geology and ore...
Paimon: Ugh... Take a look around! Is there anyone in Teyvat more qualified?
Paimon: "The requester claims to have enlisted Teyvat's number one rock expert, but Paimon: doesn't believe a word of it. Nobody understands rocks better than you!"
Zhongli: You appear to have taken his claim quite personally on my behalf.
Paimon: "Oh, no no... it's just... Uncle Dai doesn't know what he's talking about!"
Paimon: Paimon: just wants to... enlighten him...
Zhongli: "Hahaha, I see. Well then, it will be my pleasure to accompany you."
Paimon: Really!?
Zhongli: But I should inform you that despite my expertise... I cannot necessarily claim to be a leading authority.
Zhongli: "We are at all times adrift in a sea of learning — new knowledge should be welcomed with open arms. Still, I imagine I will be of help to you in this endeavor. If we do encounter an expert, I look forward to broadening my own understandings."
Paimon: "Ugh... stop being so modest, Zhongli:."
Paimon: "Well, we got him! Let's head back to Uncle Dai!"
Paimon: Uncle Dai! We're back!
Uncle Dai,Oh! And this must be the friend you spoke of?
Paimon: "Yup! Paimon: doesn't know who your rock expert is, but he's got nothing on our guy!"
Zhongli: "Haha, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Still, I do have a claim to some experience in this field."
Uncle Dai,"Uh-huh, so you say. Wait till my guy gets here, then we'll see."
Uncle Dai,It's no use me singing his praises. You'll have to see for yourselves.
Kun Jun: Uh... is this the place?
Uncle Dai,"Aha! Speak of the devil! Allow me to introduce my assistant,Kun Jun:."
Uncle Dai,"Young Kun, these are two adventurers assigned to us. And as for this gentleman..."
Kun Jun: Hm...?
Zhongli: ...
Traveller: "This is Zhongli:  a consultant from the funeral parlor."
Uncle Dai,Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant... Mr. Zhongli:! I've heard about you. They say you're a man of great knowledge and many talents. I had no idea I'd be meeting you in person today.
Kun Jun: "I... I'm sure I recognize you... Have we met at the parlor? Wait, I've never been to the parlor..."
Paimon: "Uncle Dai, aren't you going to test them?"
Traveller: So that's what you were planning.
Uncle Dai,Huh? I... I wouldn't know where to start...
Paimon: "Then they can figure out a way to test each other! If Zhongli: wins, he's the assistant. If Zhongli: loses, uh... N—Never mind, Zhongli: won't lose!"
Kun Jun: "A contest? Why, it would be my pleasure!"
Zhongli: "I admire your enthusiasm, good sir."
Kun Jun: "Haha! I must say, you certainly have the look of an industry expert about you. It'll be interesting to see which one of us wins."
Paimon: Stop talking the talk and start walking the walk!
Kun Jun: "I'm just saying it like I see it, haha... Which is incidentally the only skill I have worth talking about."
Zhongli: "So you're an appraiser, Mr. Kun Jun:?"
Kun Jun: "Well, no... actually I've already forgotten what I'm in Liyue Harbor for... I was standing by the side of the road one day when Uncle Dai called me over."
Kun Jun: "He saw me holding a rock and asked me a few questions. He seemed incredibly excited, even followed me for a while. We arranged to meet here."
Paimon: Huh? How could you forget something like that?
Uncle Dai,"I saw him on my way over to Liyue Harbor, poring over rocks and muttering to himself. He looked to be very familiar with them."
Uncle Dai,"I asked him a few questions out of curiosity. To my surprise, he knew more than me, an old mining foreman! In any case, he didn't have any pressing matters, and agreed to help me."
Paimon: So... do you have a poor memory?
Kun Jun: "Not exactly... Anyway, if it's rocks you need help with, I can most certainly lend a hand."
Kun Jun: "Mr. Zhongli:  what do you make of this rock?"
Zhongli: Hmm...
Zhongli: "A glossy exterior, with a fissure that could only have been left in the wake of a volcanic eruption. If I'm not mistaken, this is a rough gem from another nation."
Kun Jun: Ah... a keen eye!
Zhongli: "It's no ordinary rough gem. Fragile surface layer, black veining... My intuition tells me that there's high-quality crystal ore inside."
Kun Jun: Remarkable. This rock does indeed hail from the vicinity of a volcano. I came across it in a market and snapped it straight up. The seller thought it was some leftover industrial remnant. They had no inkling of the treasure that lay within.
Traveller: Isn't Crystal Ore found everywhere?
Traveller: What makes this one so special?
Kun Jun: Purity and geological rarity alone aren't enough to make a treasure. Some of the most precious crystals contain deposits of water or sand.
Kun Jun: "In the moment of its formation, the crystal hidden within this stone shell captured a pocket of water. For water to be hidden in its depths, like a moon concealed within a mountain, reflecting shafts of daylight that make it through... Now that's a rare treasure."
Paimon: "Such a detailed description, almost like he saw it with his own two eyes..."
Paimon: "Say... you're not trying to hoodwink us are you? After all, we haven't even seen what's inside yet!"
Zhongli: Everything he said is true.
Zhongli: "Most crystals are born in high-temperature environments. Heat and water aren't natural bedfellows of course, which is why crystals with water deposits are so sought-after. Moreover, this particular crystal contains mountain lake water. A rare find indeed."
Paimon: "Well if Zhongli: says so, it must be true..."
Kun Jun: "I've yet to encounter anyone with a judgment as shrewd as yours, Mr. Zhongli:. How did you know exactly what lay within?"
Zhongli: "I've seen many such stones in my time, I recognized it immediately. I hope you didn't mind me flaunting my experience, Mr. Kun Jun:?"
Kun Jun: Of course not! I feel I've met a kindred spirit here today. I hope you will accept my friendship.
Kun Jun: "Uncle Dai, it would be a mistake for Mr. Zhongli: not to join us! Trust me when I say that his level of expertise is unrivaled in the trade. You won't come across another of his caliber in your lifetime."
Uncle Dai,"Very well, there is strength in numbers after all! Everyone, follow me to The Chasm. There are men counting on you to find them."
Paimon: "Whoa, this mine is huge..."
Uncle Dai,This is where the incident occurred.
Uncle Dai,"Six days ago, a group of us left the site to attend to other matters. When we returned, the four men we'd left behind had vanished."
Uncle Dai,I led a team around the entire mine but found no trace. That's when I decided to enlist help.
Zhongli: So four miners have disappeared.
Uncle Dai,"Yes. There were ten of us. We lost Long, Bold Cen, Brave Cen, and Mao. I worked with all of them."
Zhongli: Workers in this trade are usually young men in the prime of their lives. Could it be that the four of them left for another mine?
Uncle Dai,"Unlikely. There's no other lodging for miles around, and we didn't pass any other mines on the way over."
Kun Jun: Huh... such a huge mine. Did you really manage to explore every corner?
Uncle Dai,"Underground, overground... we left no stone unturned. We tried everything short of digging further into the earth itself. How could four sturdy young men just vanish into the bedrock?"
Zhongli: We'll need to explore the site ourselves before extracting any conclusions.
Uncle Dai,"Very well, I'll wait here, please proceed wherever you'd like. If you come across any clues, let me know straight away."
Paimon: So strange... how could the four of them just suddenly disappear...? Did they run away from something?
Paimon: Let's look around first and see if we can find any clues!
Uncle Dai,I'll leave the investigations to you.
Kun Jun: We'll work more efficiently if we split up. I'll start my investigations here.
Kun Jun: Hmm... let's start with the details... what type of rocks do we have here...
Bravo,Where did my friends disappear to? Ugh... I tremble just thinking about it.
Paimon: Over here! What's this?
Paimon: "A pile of shirts, some trousers..."
Zhongli: "A few everyday items, they must belong to Uncle Dai and his men."
Paimon: "One, two, three, four..."
Paimon: "Huh... that seems right. Ten shirts, ten pairs of trousers."
Paimon: "These must be spares, right? Look, Uncle Dai's clothes are identical."
Zhongli: The four of them have been gone for six days without a change of clothes.
Paimon: "There's also a few handkerchiefs and some soap lying around... Oh, and some tool belts."
Zhongli: Items for washing one's face before the dawn shift... mining equipment...
Paimon: So... they didn't take any supplies...
Zhongli: "Hmm, correct."
Traveller: Maybe they didn't need them?
Traveller: Maybe they just forgot them?
Zhongli: Improbable.
Zhongli: There are four pickaxes missing. It seems likely they left with the tools of their trade.
Zhongli: "They had time to take their tools, but not their everyday items? Curious."
Paimon: "Huh... why would someone set off with their tools, but leave their luggage behind?"
Zhongli: "One :  They were working close by and didn't need to move their personal effects. But seeing as they've yet to return, this seems an unlikely hypothesis."
Zhongli: "Or, two :  They were forced to leave and had no time to think about their supplies."
Paimon: Oh...!
Traveller: Do you think... someone kidnapped them?
Zhongli: It's certainly a possibility. We'll need more clues before any further inference can be made.
Paimon: "If they didn't leave, maybe they were made to leave... Let's make a note and let Uncle Dai know."
Paimon: "Kun Jun:  what do you have there?"
Kun Jun: "Oh, right on time."
Zhongli: Did you find anything?
Kun Jun: "There's a chunk of ore here, perhaps there are clues within."
Paimon: Ore? What does it have to do with the disappearance?
Kun Jun: Let's find out. I'll give it a try. A moment please.
Kun Jun: ... Okay...
Zhongli: ...
Paimon: Uh... Looks like he's concentrating really hard. What's he up to?
Kun Jun: I see... four men... following someone out of the mine... it looks like a child.
Paimon: A child? What's a child doing in a mine!?
Kun Jun: I'm not sure...
Paimon: "Also, how did you ""see"" anything exactly?"
Kun Jun: Oh! I don't mean "see" in the traditional sense... I—I would appreciate it if what I'm about to tell you remained a secret. It's a little odd... I've never dared to tell anyone before.
Kun Jun: I can... perceive the memories of ore.
Paimon: Huh—!?
Zhongli: "Perceive?" So there's no... conjecture at work?
Paimon: You mean you can put your hand on a rock and — boom! It just happens?
Kun Jun: "I've always sensed that ore contains ""memories."" Sometimes it records events that occur in the surrounding area. All I have to do is touch one and focus my attention, and the memories come to me."
Paimon: Amazing! So you can find out everything that ever happened there!
Kun Jun: "It depends on the ore. Some ores have astounding memories. Others, like Iron Ore and White Iron Ore aren't up to much. Their memories are hazy."
Kun Jun: Cor Lapis and crystal memories are much stronger.They record more events and in greater detail.
Zhongli: "Stone-seeing... fascinating. A rare ability indeed. It was prudent of Uncle Dai to recruit you, Mr. Kun Jun:."
Kun Jun: "Haha, I'm glad I can be of assistance."
Kun Jun: "Based on what I saw, I believe they followed this path."
Zhongli: "This will take us north, away from the mine."
Paimon: North... another clue for Uncle Dai! Let's make a note of it.
Kun Jun: Could it be that the child I saw kidnapped them? Hmm...
Zhongli: "Excuse me sir, are you one of the workers here?"
Bravo,"Ah! Yes, yes! You must be here about the disappearance. Please find them if you can!"
Bravo,"I... I don't know what happened. The weather was gloomy that day, the foreman left with a few men."
Bravo,I stayed behind with the other four. After a while I decided to take a break... just to catch my breath!
Bravo,"I ended up falling asleep in the shelter inside. When I woke up, there was no sight of them! I'd only just been speaking with them and suddenly... they'd vanished..."
Bravo,Maybe... maybe I'm next...
Zhongli: "So the men that were out working disappeared, with the only one left to tell the tale having been asleep in a shelter."
Zhongli: Perhaps an accident occurred on-site.
Paimon: Oh... What a scary thought...
Paimon: An on-site accident... We should note that down too.
Paimon: We've found some clues. Time to report back to Uncle Dai.
Uncle Dai,You're back! How are the investigations going?
Zhongli: We found three clues in the vicinity.
Zhongli: "First, there are four missing pickaxes, yet everyday items are still in their place. This suggests that your men didn't leave of their own accord, but were forced to."
Uncle Dai,Forced to!? But... who would kidnap miners?
Zhongli: "Who, indeed. Second, there were five workers at the mine. One of them left the site to take respite. When he awoke, his colleagues had disappeared without a trace."
Zhongli: Those who kept working all disappeared. The one who left early emerged safe and sound. It would appear that the incident occurred on-site.
Uncle Dai,"Now that you mention it, I recall Bravo saying that he took a break."
Uncle Dai,Could someone have entered the site and simply walked away with them!?
Zhongli: This leads me to my third point. Mr. Kun Jun: here made good use of his... expert techniques... to arrive at a conclusion. It was a child that took your men away.
Uncle Dai,A child!? But there are no settlements here for miles around! There's no way a child would have made it over to the mine!
Paimon: "Unlikely as it sounds, that's our conclusion. Your men were following a child."
Uncle Dai,Where did they go?
Zhongli: "We believe that they followed the road north, away from the mine and toward the ruins."
Uncle Dai,"North! Right, I'll rally my men and head in pursuit."
Traveller: Do you need help?
Uncle Dai,"You've been invaluable to the investigation, but leave the legwork to us. If we set off now and make haste, we might be able to catch them."
Zhongli: "Not so fast. The incident occurred six days ago. Even if they set out on foot, they will have covered a lot of ground by now."
Uncle Dai,*sigh* You're right... New plan. I'll lead my search party over to the settlements further out and make some inquiries.
Uncle Dai,There are only a few settlements around here with lodging for the night. We'll go investigate and see if we can come up with anything.
Uncle Dai,"In the meantime you could keep looking for clues. If we don't see each other, let's reconvene at Wangshu Inn tomorrow evening."
Zhongli: Agreed.
Uncle Dai,"Alright, me and my men will get going!"
Paimon: "So... they're gonna talk to the people over at the settlements, while we keep investigating here..."
Zhongli: Correct.
Paimon: But... there aren't any more clues at the mine... Shouldn't we go north?
Zhongli: Wait... I believe we're missing someone.
Paimon: Huh?
Paimon: "Oh yeah, where's Kun Jun:? Paimon: bets he's still investigating. Let's go find him!"
Paimon: Kun Jun:! What are you searching for? We're all out of clues! Let's get going!
Kun Jun: "Ah, apologies, I'm conducting a quick search for my own benefit. I'm looking for a precious stone known asDragonfall."
Zhongli: Dragonfall?
Traveller: Never heard of it.
Traveller: Not my area of expertise.
Zhongli: Dragonfall is often used in forging. What use do you have for it?
Kun Jun: I... I don't know.
Kun Jun: "I—I'm sorry, I don't recall why I'm seeking it... I've been feeling very... absent lately. Name and address aside, I'm having trouble remembering things."
Kun Jun: "In fact, I've been feeling extremely... anxious... as if there's something I've forgotten to finish. It's... an unpleasant sensation."
Paimon: "Oh, Paimon: knows that feeling! When you know you've forgotten something but you can't remember exactly what it is."
Kun Jun: "Ugh... I don't even know where to start with it, I've been... aimlessly wandering. That day at the market, I overheard a conversation while I was buying something. They mentioned Dragonfall."
Kun Jun: "It sounded so familiar to me, as if whatever it was I had to do was linked to that stone... So I decided to look for some."
Kun Jun: "Perhaps if I can retrieve some, I'll remember what it is I have to do."
Zhongli: "I see... If I am able to during our endeavour, I will help you look for this stone."
Kun Jun: "Really? Oh, thank you Mr. Zhongli:! You're too kind!"
Zhongli: Think nothing of it.
Paimon: Shouldn't we get going?
Zhongli: "Heading north from The Chasm, we'll reach Lingju Pass. If this is indeed the path they chose, there will be traces."
Paimon: Great! Let's have a look!
Paimon: "Wait, there are tracks here!"
Paimon: These must have been left by the miners!
Zhongli: "Let us make our way to the end of Lingju Pass. If there are no footprints there, it would suggest that the miners are still within the pass itself. However, if we find new tracks, we can follow them wherever they may lead."
Paimon: Hey! Footprints!
Zhongli: It would appear that they made their way through Lingju Pass and kept moving.
Paimon: If we follow their footprints we should be able to find where they went!
Paimon: Oh no! The footprints end here!
Zhongli: "We should inquire with anyone nearby. If the miners came through here, they may well have seen them."
Paimon: "Hi there, have you seen anyone dressed like a miner around here?"
Yonggui,A miner? I'm afraid not.
Paimon: *sigh* Let's try someone else.
Yonggui,*sigh* My legs don't work like they used to... Guess my age is catching up with me...
Paimon: Hello! Have you seen any miners nearby? About this tall — four of them?
Wei,Stop bothering me! Can't you see I'm cloud-watching?
Paimon: "Geez! A little grumpy, aren't we?"
Paimon: "Whatever, let's go ask someone else."
Wei,You again... I'm busy!
Paimon: "Hey there, seen any miners?"
Ling,...It must have been about four or five days ago. There were a few men who came through here carrying baskets and picks... I guess that could have been them?
Paimon: Yeah! That's them!
Zhongli: Four or five days ago? It appears that they were moving slower than we'd anticipated. Traversing the geography of Lingju Pass must have held them up.
Ling,It was so strange! Four big guys with lifeless expressions... It was like they were in some sort of trance! And there was a child staggering in front of them...
Zhongli: "Huh, this child... did you see what they look like?"
Ling,"I caught a glimpse... blue hair, short. I think... I think it was a girl! She wasn't smiling, in fact she looked very serious."
Zhongli: And they took this road?
Ling,"Yes, they followed it straight from here."
Paimon: Let's go after them!
Ling,I've never seen anything like it... Were they sleepwalking? So bizarre...
Paimon: More footprints... *gasp* There's a person over there!
Wanyu,"Help! Please, save me!"
Paimon: "Is that one of the people we're looking for? Oh! Rescue first, ask questions later!"
Wanyu,Those monsters were so aggressive — they must have noticed me walking through! Before I knew it they were all over me... Thank you all for saving me.
Wanyu,"My name is Wanyu, I belong to Liyue's Shenglu Hall. I head up our human culture and civilization research."
Paimon: Huh? You sure you're not... a miner?
Wanyu,A miner?
Paimon: Yeah. We're looking for a group of four strong fellas carrying mining equipment.
Wanyu,I... I think I saw those people.
Paimon: Really!?
Wanyu,Yes. I set off from Nantianmen the day before yesterday heading for Lingju Pass. About halfway there I came across some people — a few men and a child.
Traveller: Can you be a bit more specific?
Wanyu,"I was in a hurry, I didn't get a good look. I'm afraid I'm not even sure what they looked like... apologies."
Zhongli: I think that's all we needed to hear. Thank you.
Wanyu,I hope it's useful to you!
Wanyu,"I'd better get going, there's a conference I need to attend. Again, thank you all for your help."
Paimon: "According to this scholar, the miners were heading for Nantianmen."
Kun Jun: Can we be absolutely sure that it was the men that we're looking for?
Paimon: A child with a group of adults! Sounds pretty close to Paimon:!
Traveller: It could easily have been a different group.
Paimon: Uh... but...
Kun Jun: "Hey, perhaps that rock over there can tell us more!"
Paimon: Aha! Paimon: nearly forgot about our secret weapon!
Kun Jun: "It looks promising, I'll do my best."
Kun Jun: Hmm...
Kun Jun: ...
Kun Jun: It's the same group alright. They followed this road.
Zhongli: "Haha, Mr. Kun Jun:  your stone-seeing is something I won't forget in a hurry."
Kun Jun: "I suppose it is an asset, though I rarely find a use for it. But praise from Mr. Zhongli: is high praise indeed."
Paimon: It's a good thing we brought our "Kun Jun: compass" along! We would've lost all sense of direction a long time ago.
Kun Jun: "Hahaha, you think so? I guess it's been a worthwhile trip then."
Kun Jun: It feels like... like we're cracking a criminal case. It's a lot of fun.
Zhongli: "Be that as it may, we would do well to keep our guards high."
Zhongli: Four fully-grown men in a trance-like state... walking ceaselessly day and night... over hills and mountains... led by a child... This is no ordinary incident.
Kun Jun: "Oh! You're quite right, Mr. Zhongli:. We should have our wits about us."
Zhongli: "That's not all. Our scholar was attacked by Geovishap Hatchlings, but the level of aggression they exhibited was... unusual."
Zhongli: We have encountered many clues along the way. So far they've pointed us in the right direction.
Zhongli: "Hmm, the miners headed in the direction of Nantianmen the day before yesterday. From here they would have had to navigate a perilous mountain road. If their destination is indeed Nantianmen, we should be able to catch up with them."
Paimon: Great! No time to lose!
Zhongli: "I left a mark in the vicinity just now. If Uncle Dai does pass through here, it should guide him to us."
Paimon: Clever thinking! A classic Zhongli: move.
Paimon: Hey! Over here on the ground! Is this one of the missing people?
Kun Jun: There's a basket lying here too... This must be one of the miners.
Paimon: Hey! Hello? Can you hear us?
Zhongli: "Judging by his appearance, he must have collapsed from exhaustion."
Paimon: Should we wake him up?
Miner,I can... I can still dig...
Paimon: *gasp* Sounds like he's whispering something...
Traveller: He looks like he's struggling...
Traveller: He looks like he's trying to stand up.
Zhongli: It seems that he thinks he still has work to do. Something's not right.
Zhongli: There's a camp nearby. We should take him there and monitor his condition before deciding our next move.
Zhongli: ...
Paimon: "How is he? H—He won't die, right?"
Zhongli: "He's worked himself into a stupor. Thankfully, he's not in serious danger."
Traveller: How did he get so exhausted?
Paimon: Paimon: heard him talking about digging for something. Did he dig himself into this state?
Zhongli: It's certainly a possibility.
Traveller: Strange...
Traveller: Wasn't he brought here?
Kun Jun: Hm? It looks like there's something in his pocket...
Kun Jun: Are these... ore fragments?
Kun Jun: ...
Kun Jun: I just witnessed the memories within these ore fragments. This person brought these fragments out of the mine. He's one of the four that we're searching for.
Zhongli: How he came to be here is what we need to understand.
Paimon: "So he was kidnapped, and then... abandoned here..."
Paimon: "But if they didn't need him, why bring him all the way out here?"
Zhongli: Unless something happened... something that led him to fall behind.
Paimon: Ugh...
Paimon: Paimon:'s had enough! This is too mysterious!
Kun Jun: Oh! Wait a moment! Seeing these fragments has jogged my memory — I have something for you.
Paimon: What is it? Ooh! Is it a present?
Zhongli: Something... for us?
Kun Jun: "As I mentioned, before I met Uncle Dai I was in a daze. After setting out with you on this case, it feels like a fog is lifting."
Kun Jun: I was so happy when Uncle Dai enlisted you to help. I would never have managed to track down these clues by myself.
Kun Jun: "These are some crystals that I bought from the market. Not any old crystals mind you — this purity is extraordinarily rare! One for each of you. A memory, if you will."
Paimon: It's beautiful... Oh — and the colors change as you turn it! It's like a different crystal from each angle.
Traveller: Looks expensive...
Traveller: Can I really keep this?
Kun Jun: "But of course, take it."
Kun Jun: And this one is for Mr. Zhongli:.
Zhongli: ...
Kun Jun: Huh? I—Is something wrong? Not to your liking?
Zhongli: On the contrary... I just hadn't anticipated receiving a gift during the current circumstances.
Zhongli: "But, thank you. I will take good care of it."
Kun Jun: I'm pleased you like them. It's nice to be able to give a gift that others can appreciate.
Kun Jun: "Oh! I see more rocks over there. You should all get some rest, I'm going to walk awhile — perhaps there are more memories to uncover."
Paimon: "You sure like rocks, huh Kun Jun:..."
Kun Jun: "Ores are the crystals of the earth, the sediment of time itself. I feel at peace among them."
Kun Jun: "Get some rest, and call me when you're ready to set off. I won't be far."
Traveller: "He'll be okay on his own, right?"
Zhongli: "Rest easy, I surveyed the area. There's no danger here."
Zhongli: "Oh, however, there is something I wanted to discuss with you."
Paimon: Huh? What's with the seriousness all of a sudden?
Zhongli: Traveler... DoesDragonfallmean anything to you?
Traveller: No.
Paimon: You mean the ore that Kun Jun:'s looking for? What's so special about it?
Zhongli: "Dragonfall is an incredibly rare ore used in forging. The majority of regular crystals are formed in high-temperature environments. Dragonfall, on the other hand, is formed as a product of elemental reactions."
Paimon: Elemental reactions can produce material objects?
Zhongli: "Indeed they can. However, only a minority can survive for long periods of time."
Zhongli: "Dragonfall first emerged in the midst of a great battle, thousands of years ago. Powerful clashes of elemental energy gave birth to elemental crystals. When the fighting ceased, these geological remnants were miraculously preserved."
Paimon: Cooool...
Zhongli: "And yet they are crystal creations all the same, few and far between, relatively unknown. A few hundred years ago, they were virtually mined into obscurity."
Zhongli: "Why is it then, that a citizen of Liyue now wishes to strike upon ore that has long since vanished from the earth?"
Paimon: "Yeah! If he knows of its existence, surely he knows all of it's already been mined?"
Paimon: Weird... Paimon: doesn't get it...
Zhongli: There are those in the mining trade who retain a keen interest in Dragonfall. But for someone like Mr. Kun Jun:... whose motivations for seeking it are unclear even unto himself... it's practically unheard-of.
Traveller: Perhaps he has ulterior motives.
Paimon: Ulterior motives... *gasp* Is he a villain!?
Zhongli: A conclusion that is presently impossible to reach. We must watch... and wait.
Zhongli: "Don't forget, rescuing those miners is the primary objective. As for anything else... Sooner or later the tide will reveal the lie of the land."
Zhongli: "We're drawing closer to our goal. I believe we should continue to follow this road through. Now that we've found one, the others won't be far away."
Zhongli: "When you're well-rested, call Mr. Kun Jun: over to us. We still have more investigation ahead."
Zhongli: "We should ensure this miner is settled here at the camp. Once we've brought this matter to a close, we can return and attend to him. I suggest we leave a note for Uncle Dai. If he does find the camp he'll know what to do."
Miner,Ugh... Oh...
 Miner,(He looks exhausted.)
Paimon: Kun Jun:! We need to get going!
Kun Jun: No problem! I'm done here.
Zhongli: "Any results, Mr. Kun Jun:?"
Kun Jun: "There are many beautiful rocks here, but nothing out of the ordinary. I couldn't find any clues."
Kun Jun: "Then again, the memories of ore can shift with the passage of time and the changing of the environment."
Traveller: Is there a pattern to it?
Kun Jun: "Hmm, difficult to say... I feel that ore memories tend to be from the recent past."
Paimon: So there's never any ancient memories?
Kun Jun: "Rocks endure, but as eons pass their memories are erased. Those memories that survive are rooted in powerful emotion or thought."
Paimon: That makes sense — it is the same for people!
Kun Jun: Indeed... Let's keep going.
Kun Jun: "Wow, such an immense tree!"
Paimon: And there's so many mysterious-looking crystals up there too... amazing.
Zhongli: This ancient tree...
Zhongli: "Let's conduct separate investigations. I'll take that area, perhaps you could survey this section."
Traveller: Sure.
Traveller: Be careful.
Zhongli: Alright then.
Paimon: "Kun Jun:  can you see anything worth investigating?"
Kun Jun: Well... there is this stone tablet here.
Paimon: Doesn't seem very interesting... Paimon:'s gonna look over there.
Kun Jun: "Huh? It's worth a try, surely. Let me see..."
Kun Jun: ...
Kun Jun: ...!
Kun Jun: (This is...)
Paimon: Hey! What's wrong?
Kun Jun: "...Just a bit light-headed... It's passed, nothing to worry about."
Traveller: Did you see anything?
Kun Jun: Not... hmm... not yet...
Paimon: "*sigh* Whatever, Paimon:'s going to investigate over there. Why don't you climb the tree and have a look, (Traveler)?"
Traveller: You're sure there'll be clues in the tree?
Paimon: "If you don't try you don't know! Anyway, you'll be able to get a good look at our surroundings from up there!"
Kun Jun: ...
Kun Jun: Oh! Uh... you think so?
Paimon: "When has Paimon: ever come up with a bad idea, hmm?"
Paimon: "Wait a minute... Paimon: can fly! *sigh* Alright, Paimon: will go, you wait here, Paimon: will—"
Zhongli: "All of you, come here."
Paimon: Huh? Zhongli:'s voice came from... behind the tree. Did he find another clue?
Paimon: "Quick, let's go see! Maybe he found another miner!"
Zhongli: This has been newly dug. It would appear our answer is up ahead.
Paimon: Is that a voice coming from the tunnel? Eek! Someone else go first!
Zhongli: Compose yourselves. I will lead us in.
Kun Jun: ...
Zhongli: "There is an unusual presence emanating from inside the tunnel. Prepare yourselves, and tread lightly."
Zhongli: This is...
Paimon: The missing miners are here!
Paimon: Wh—What are they digging for?
Zhongli: I'm afraid that this whole tunnel
Zhongli: Is the fruit of their strenuous labor
Paimon: That gate...
Paimon: Has it been there all along?
Zhongli: Digging a tunnel to this ancient seal
Zhongli: Had they not been discovered
Zhongli: They would undoubtedly persevere
Zhongli: Until they opened the gate.
Paimon: "...So behind this seal, there's..."
Paimon: Aah!!!
Paimon: What do we do? We can't hurt them!
Paimon: What type of monster is this!?
Azhdaha,Morax... you arrive at my doorstep of your own volition. Excellent... taking revenge for sealing me away will be all the easier!
Zhongli: So.... the little girl is your power incarnate.
Zhongli: "But if you recall, Azhdaha... this is not how we intended for events to transpire."
Azhdaha,Waste not your words! Your life is mine!
Azhdaha,Argh...! Is once not enough!? You would forsake me again!?
Zhongli: "If that is what you choose to believe, so be it."
Zhongli: He who bears the weight of memory is destined to shoulder the burden of truth. As it ought to be.
Paimon: Watch out!
Kun Jun: Allow me.
Zhongli: You've recovered? How can that...
Kun Jun: "Focus your efforts, Morax!"
Azhdaha,Morax! You think you can destroy me!?
Zhongli: ...
Azhdaha,Ah...!
Jiu: Morax! A thousand years after you sealed me underground... you return for the second time...
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: "You should call it by its name, Azhdaha... fate."
Jiu: Fate?
Jiu: Fate!!! Hahahaha!
Jiu: "So here lies the wisdom of the gods? Destroy all deemed redundant, enlist tyrants to ravage the wilderness!"
Kun Jun: No. You have forgotten.
Paimon: ...That... that voice...
Zhongli: Azhdaha...
Paimon: Huh? Kun Jun:!?
Kun Jun: Morax. It's been a while.
Jiu: Y—You're...
Kun Jun: Azhdaha... the very same.
Zhongli: During the battle... you embued us with your power...
Kun Jun: Haha... yes. It was all I could manage.
Traveller: Then... which one is the real Azhdaha?
Traveller: You're not Kun Jun:?
Kun Jun: "Forgive me for concealing the truth, Traveler. There were things that only became clear to me upon reaching this tree."
Kun Jun: Allow me to elaborate. I am not Azhdaha the whole... but a fragment.
Kun Jun: "Heaven and earth, yin and yang, opposing forces... You can consider the existence of me and the Azhdaha you see there, to be a reflection of such polarities. ""We"" are a schism of the will... the will of Azhdaha."
Paimon: So... so there are two Azhdahas!?
Jiu: No! It can't be! That's impossible...!
Kun Jun: "When the seal loosened, your power manifested in this world as a child. With this new identity, you were able to vent about the forces that suppressed you... but would anyone listen... would they even care?"
Kun Jun: That's when it occurred to you. The loosening of the seal constituted an opportunity to strike back. Kidnapping the miners was all in aid of digging to the entrance to the seal itself. Your plan was to launch an attack on both ends. From outside... and within. Thereby fully destroying the seal.
Jiu: "The audacity! Are you insane!? If you truly are a part of me, how is it you find yourself standing on the side of the betrayer!?"
Kun Jun: "I was another power awakened with the loosening of the seal. Too weak to reincarnate, but strong enough to possess a human body."
Kun Jun: I was barely conscious... I couldn't remember who I was. Only the past would elicit a reaction from me... But my aim was clear:  Find Morax... and aid him in stopping you.
Zhongli: "I had sensed that something was amiss when you mentionedDragonfall. Had your power been but a little stronger, I would've recognized you."
Kun Jun: "Don't blame yourself, I have changed beyond all recognition. Only when I touched the stone tablet... did I truly remember."
Kun Jun: "It's been so long. A secret beyond all comprehension, of youthful humanity and ancient dragon-kind... Morax, do you want to tell the tale?"
Zhongli: There would be no harm in it. The decision is yours.
Kun Jun: "Haha, you haven't changed. Then allow me."
Kun Jun: "Azhdaha was once a friend and ally of the Geo Archon, Morax, with a lifespan far exceeding that of mankind. However, that which is derived of the earth is no more or less than the earth itself..."
Kun Jun: "The memories of rocks do not last long. Those memories that survive are rooted in powerful emotion. But as time passes, so these memories fade into obscurity. Erosion is the world's greatest destroyer of memories."
Traveller: Erosion...?
Kun Jun: "Erosion ground Azhdaha's consciousness into oblivion. Slowly, he forgot the face of his old friend, and his memories of defending Liyue Harbor disintegrated."
Kun Jun: "Azhdaha, now incomplete, became irascible... aggressive."
Jiu: What would you expect!? It was humanity that attacked the Ley Lines that sustained me!
Kun Jun: This much is true. Which is why "you" attacked The Chasm... why "you" waged war against Morax.
Kun Jun: "In the beginning, in order to open up new territory and increase production, the citizens of Liyue came to the mountains to mine. Overexploitation caused the Ley Lines to quake, which brought untold suffering to ""us."""
Kun Jun: "Erosion made ""us"" even more savage. No matter how we struggled, we lost the ability to coexist with humanity... we lost all reason."
Kun Jun: "Morax shared with us some of his power, to prevent further erosion. But... it was futile. Everything returns to dust. It is the natural order, an unstoppable force."
Kun Jun: "And so, ""we"" became ""you."" And from your will... ""I"" emerged."
Jiu: ...
Kun Jun: I am your final contract. Witness the promise between Azhdaha and Morax. You can hate me... but you cannot deny me.
Jiu: No... no...
Kun Jun: "I am the remnants of Azhdaha's benevolence, the echo of a contract set in stone. I harbor a willingness to go further, a willingness to coexist peacefully with mankind."
Jiu: "No, no! It is I, Azhdaha, forged of elemental crystal, bearer of the weight and memories of the earth, older than the mountains and the oceans that decides! I will not swear allegiance to this insect!"
Kun Jun: Morax is not an insect.
Jiu: A lord over insects is nothing but an insect in turn!
Kun Jun: You forgot yourself. Nobody held Morax in higher regard than you or I.
Kun Jun: "That which you have forgotten, I hold here in my heart. If you are the memory of the earth... then I am the memory of coexistence... of coexistence with humanity."
Kun Jun: "All powers under heaven,[Note 1]rise and fall of land and sea..."
Jiu: ...A star appears within the wild... a sun ascends as bright as... jade...
Zhongli: ...
Jiu: Strange... What... what is this feeling? And all this...
Kun Jun: "You are spent, and I will soon disappear. Before I do, heed these words."
Kun Jun: "In the wilderness, snow falls on a spring day. In an instant it will melt. Even where it is fleeting and leaves no trace. Even where it will never fall again..."
Jiu: "No, that isn't true! I don't accept this as fate!"
Kun Jun: Perhaps it isn't. But it remains... an inevitable misfortune.
Jiu: Mor... ax...
Paimon: The little girl vanished...
Traveller: Sealed away?
Traveller: Eroded?
Zhongli: "Are you satisfied, Azhdaha?"
Kun Jun: I had to make amends. Satisfaction had no part in it.
Kun Jun: "So, Morax... you call yourself Zhongli: these days?"
Zhongli: I do.
Kun Jun: "Well, I'm afraid old habits die hard. To me, you're Morax."
Zhongli: As you please.
Kun Jun: I never did forget your gift of sight.
Zhongli: I hardly lifted a finger. Think nothing of it.
Kun Jun: "And yet you could see. You wouldn't know the yearning of a blind dragon, searching for the sun. A pair of eyes, from Morax to Azhdaha. This... I will remember this."
Kun Jun: ...
Zhongli: Your power is nearly spent.
Kun Jun: "...Perceptive as always, my friend."
Zhongli: "Shall we get going, you and I?"
Kun Jun: Surely the pressing matter is still that of the miners trapped outside the seal?
Zhongli: "Indeed. Hence the need to get going, to fix the damage left in your wake."
Kun Jun: "Ha... straight down to business, as always. Let's go."
Paimon: Huh? How did we get here? We need to go back and check on the miners!
Miner,Argh...
Miner,Ugh... ugh...
Miner,Oh...
Uncle Dai,So there you are! My men and I found your clues and followed them straight here.
Uncle Dai,"We found Mao in a tent at the campsite unconscious! It seems he'll be okay. Sadly, we found no trace of the other three..."
Uncle Dai,"Huh? Young Kun, wh—what is...?"
Kun Jun: "Nothing, pay it no mind. Those three miners are over in that cave there."
Uncle Dai,Cave? What happened!?
Zhongli: "They're exhausted, but not in danger. Don't worry."
Uncle Dai,"R—Right, well... Thank you, all of you! I better go and see how they're doing."
Kun Jun: So you're taking them back to Liyue Harbor?
Uncle Dai,That's right!
Kun Jun: Can I come with you?
Uncle Dai,"No problem! You rescued my men. I'll be happy to assist all of you in any way I can. I'll be back soon, I need to assess their condition."
Paimon: "Kun Jun:... Oh, uh... we should be calling you Azhdaha... You're coming back to Liyue Harbor too, right?"
Kun Jun: "Not I, merely this body."
Kun Jun: "Once I'm gone, the true owner will accompany the miners back to Liyue. Kun Jun: hails from a family of famous artisans — he too will be famous in time. It would be a shame for someone of his talent to go missing."
Zhongli: You always did have a great admiration for blacksmiths.
Kun Jun: "Curious how swords and daggers are blind, yet their creators see so much. Perhaps empathy is mankind's proudest achievement after all?"
Zhongli: Azhdaha. I am no longer the Geo Archon.
Kun Jun: ...I can sense it.
Zhongli: Today I am just an ordinary citizen of Liyue.
Kun Jun: Even you met such a fate... Let's get the difficult part out of the way. I cannot guarantee that I won't be awoken a second time.
Zhongli: "No matter. If that day comes to pass, Liyue must prepare itself to face you."
Kun Jun: And how will Liyue fare without Rex Lapis?
Zhongli: "Even without a god above, this remains a nation of men. I was once their god, I ought to be here to witness their rise and fall."
Kun Jun: "All life is shaped and then ground away by the endless flow of time. You were always the strongest among us, yet it would seem that even you have been eroded..."
Kun Jun: "That's unimportant... fate is ordained by heaven. Even if our mission had already concluded, it would be cowardly not to strike out on the road of departure."
Kun Jun: "You may live forever, doomed to a lonely existence... yet even this is temporary. When you reach the end of time, those people, those past and future relationships predetermined by fate... They will be waiting for you."
Zhongli: I do not pretend to match your rhetoric when it comes to the subject of a life long-lived. I fear that the life of an elemental being is longer than any in this world.
Kun Jun: "Were it not so, you would have killed me long ago, and would not be having to face me again now."
Zhongli: "You've brought a smile to my face. When all is said and done, a reunion between old friends is an auspicious occasion."
Kun Jun: That day in The Chasm? Did you hesitate?
Zhongli: "A heart of stone is a heart nonetheless. But I am the God of Contracts, and was, for a time, a god of the people of Liyue."
Kun Jun: "You chose justice, but did not forsake your kindness. You came to me not as an assassin, and so I was willingly sealed away."
Zhongli: "The movements of the Earth Dragon can tremble the earth and shake the heavens. With your abilities, even at my full strength, I struggled to confront you, let alone seal you away."
Kun Jun: Hence "my" inception.
Kun Jun: "Do not forget that I was there with Liyue's founder. The face may have changed, but the content of the contract remains intact."
Kun Jun: "Old friend, God of Contracts. I hereby honor our agreement."
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: "Thank you, Azhdaha."
Kun Jun: "My life is nigh on eternal. I will go on with the infinite flow of time. And you, Morax... You too will live for many a day to come."
Kun Jun: ...
Zhongli: You're leaving?
Kun Jun: "If it is fated, Morax... we will meet again."
Paimon: Huh!?
Traveller: So is this...
Traveller: ...the real Kun Jun:?
Zhongli: "Yes. Don't be alarmed, he's only asleep."
Paimon: Whoa... that was so weird. It was like he... suddenly became another person.
Zhongli: In fact... we have yet to meet the real Kun Jun:.
Traveller: But what about Azhdaha...
Traveller: He was a great friend of yours.
Zhongli: He was.
Zhongli: Centuries may have passed since then... but events from a thousand years ago... remain crystal clear in my mind.
Iron Tongue Tian,"In our last tale, Rex Lapis was walking alone in the mountains. He heard a remote voice unlike any other coming from a crack in the earth. Most of the ancient Geo life forms that live below Liyue are blind, having not seen the sunlight for an age. The voice was sometimes sad and songlike, other times it was loud and thunderous. The Lord of Geo searched here and there before finally unearthing a strange stone from the bedrock."
Zhongli: "That's how Azhdaha was. I answered his wish, and took him above ground."
Iron Tongue Tian,The Lord of Geo took pity on the rock's spirit and carved it into a magnificent work of craftsmanship — a vivid representation of a dragon.
Zhongli: I bestowed him with a pair of eyes to see the world and came to an agreement with him.
Iron Tongue Tian,"With his fingers, he made two eyes. Quicker than words could tell, lightning flashed and thunder roared, and a living, breathing dragon soared into the clouds!"
Zhongli: "I agreed to let him live among the people above ground, but if the day ever came when he brought ruin to order, he would once again be sealed in the dark."
Iron Tongue Tian,"The dragon accompanied the Lord of Geo, fighting campaigns alongside him in the four corners of the world. We have a saying the eulogize these events"
Zhongli: "A thousand years ago, Azhdaha attacked The Chasm. I tried to obstruct him, fighting him tooth and nail down the length and breadth of the mine. Finally, I brought him down, and sealed him underground."
Zhongli: "During that battle, Dragonfall was born. Azhdaha could sense the stone. Subconsciously, he wanted to use it to find me."
Zhongli: "Despite being the victor, I could not claim to be stronger than he. And in his heart, he still retained an ounce of good will towards me... towards Liyue... towards life above ground."
Zhongli: He was willing to be sealed away. But as the erosion set in... he forgot.
Traveller: The power of erosion is... scary.
Traveller: Have you also been affected by erosion?
Zhongli: "Even I cannot avoid it. But there is something I understand better than most :  When the door opens, it is time to leave."
Zhongli: "The greater the power, the greater the danger erosion may bring about. The millennia may come and go, but even a stone may tire."
Traveller: Is that why you chose to leave...?
Traveller: Is that why you chose to step down as the Geo Archon...?
Zhongli: Personally sealing away an old friend... this is just one form of erosion I have endured.
Zhongli: People abandon and surrender the things they love to pursue the right path. Perhaps this is the erosion imposed on me by the natural order of this world.
Zhongli: "But I was a god of mankind. My identity may change, but my eyes will bear witness to the history of humanity."
Paimon: You still care a lot about Liyue...
Zhongli: Call it... part of my duty.
Zhongli: I must thank you both.
Paimon: No worries!
Traveller: Hold on.
Traveller: I want to ask you something.
Zhongli: Oh? About what?
Traveller: About my (brother/sister).
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon: nearly forgot!
Paimon: "So, not long ago we met a guy called Dain."
Paimon: He told us about Khaenri'ah and the punishment of the gods... That's when we realized that those events... were connected to the person we're searching for.
Traveller: My sibling.
Traveller: This is crucial for me.
Paimon: "Zhongli:  you're a god. You've lived through thousands of years of history. Surely you experienced the incident."
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: ......
Zhongli: I cannot say.
Paimon: Why!?
Traveller: ...
Paimon: You can't even give us a thread of information? This is so important to us!
Zhongli: "I understand, but I must apologize. This is my contract."
Paimon: "You mean, another past grievance? Like the incident with Azhdaha? Too painful to talk about?"
Zhongli: It was signed before it all began. I have always honored the contract... and kept my silence.
Paimon: ...How can you be like that...!?
Zhongli: "You two are friends to me. I can assure it brings me no pleasure to disappoint you. But as the God of Contracts, I cannot go back on my word."
Traveller: "Well, it's not out of character."
Traveller: I believe you.
Paimon: Would you be ready to find out?
Traveller: Perhaps.
Zhongli: It appears your understanding of this world continues to grow.
Zhongli: There are many events of ages past... many secrets that lie hidden...
Zhongli: "They have been eroded by time, forgotten by the people... abandoned."
Zhongli: But you are capable of finding them and bringing them into the light.
Zhongli: Those who come to witness... will witness. Those who are born to remember... will remember.
Zhongli: "If you take the same road as that person, there may be more difficulties ahead. But as long as you firmly believe that you are on the right path... everything has meaning."
Zhongli: "This tablet was erected by Mountain Shaper. It names Azhdaha as a terrible dragon, and serves as a warning for later generations to stay away from this place... from the seal."
Zhongli: "It's a shame... There is a fine line between good and evil. If the good and evil within him could be summarized in a single sentence... well, never mind."
